<h1>Celtics vs. Cavaliers Series Preview</h1>
<p>On Monday night the Boston Celtics defeated the Washington Wizards in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals, propelling them into a matchup with LeBron James and the idling Cleveland Cavaliers. The Celtics will come into the series with just one day of rest between series, while the Cavs have been waiting patiently for their next opponent since May 7th. The Cavaliers, like the Golden State Warriors in the West, are undefeated coming into this series, meaning the Celtics will hope to use their underdog status as motivation in their fight to get to the NBA Finals.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Regular Season Background</b></h4>
<p>The Cavaliers and Celtics met four times in the regular season and the Cavaliers came out on top in three out of the four matchups. The first three games were all decided by fewer than seven points, but the fourth matchup was a 23-point blowout win for the Cavaliers. In the first matchup on November 3rd, the Cavaliers came away with a six-point win at Quicken Loans Arena. LeBron James led the way with 30 points and a double-double. The Cavaliers also got extraordinary production from center Tristan Thompson, who put up 15 points and grabbed 14 rebounds to help the Cavaliers take down the Celtics. In the second matchup of the season, the Cavaliers once again came away with a six-point win in Cleveland. Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love led the way as they combined for 62 points, 20 rebounds, and 14 assists for Cleveland. Isaiah Thomas did all he could, cashing in 33 points and 9 assists, but- in the end- the Cavaliers were too much to handle. The third- and possibly most exciting game of the series- came at the TD Garden, where Boston came away win a four-point victory. The Celtics were led by Isaiah Thomas, who came away with 31 points on 50% shooting from the field. Al Horford also contributed 10 rebounds and 10 assists for the Celtics. The Cavaliers were without Kevin Love in this game, but they fought the entire game, led by LeBron James. James came up with a triple-double, posting 28 points, 13 rebounds, and 10 assists in the losing effort. The fourth and final game of the regular season between Boston and Cleveland was an absolute blowout that saw the Cavaliers come away with a 23-point victory. LeBron James tallied 36 points and a double-double and Boston did not have an answer.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Key Players</b></h4>
<p>The meeting between the Celtics and Cavaliers will see a matchup of two of the best players in the Eastern Conference. LeBron James is averaging 34.4 points, 9 rebounds, and 7.1 assists and the Cavaliers have walked through their first two postseason series. Guard Kyrie Irving will also play a crucial role in the series for the Cavaliers. In the 2016 NBA Finals, Irving shut down Stephen Curry and hit the game-winning shot in Game 7 to bring a championship to Cleveland. The Cavaliers will need another outstanding performance from Irving to knock off Isaiah Thomas and the Celtics. Another important player for the Cavaliers in this series is Kevin Love. The last time these two teams met in the postseason, Kevin Love was injured in Game 1. Love has an intriguing matchup against Al Horford and Amir Johnson and if he can take advantage of it, the Cavaliers will benefit. Isaiah Thomas has put up 25.4 points and 6.5 assists per game in this postseason. For the Celtics to come away with a series win over the Cavaliers, Thomas is going to have to play the best basketball of his career and evoke memories of Larry Bird. Also for the Celtics, they will need their bench to outplay Clevelandâ€™s and Al Horford will have to be able to grab rebounds. If those things do not happen, the Cavaliers will have a cake walk into the NBA Finals. However, the series might not be as easy as the Cavaliers think. Boston played well against Cleveland in three out of the four regular season matchups and a big reason why was because of Isaiah Thomas and Al Horford. If those two do what they are capable of, the NBA fans should be in for a good treat.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Prediction</b></h4>
<p>The Cleveland Cavaliers will come out on top in this series because of sheer talent and frankly, LeBron James. However, I expect Boston to put up a fight with Isaiah Thomas leading the charge. Because of the reasons above, the Cavaliers will come out on top in six games.</p>
