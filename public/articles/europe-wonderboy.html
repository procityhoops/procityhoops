<h1>Europe's Wonderboy</h1>

<p>The 2017 college basketball season is off to an exciting start with a loaded crop of NBA prospects. Marvin Bagley III (Fr.) is a unique talent averaging 23 points and 11 boards for the Duke Blue Devils. He is a great athlete for his size (6’11), and has shown the ability to guard all five positions while dropping 30 and 15 on any given night. Deandre Ayton (Fr.) for Arizona has been drawing comparisons to Joel Embiid early in the season. Standing at 7-1, Ayton has averaged 20 points and 12 boards for the Wildcats with a plethora of post moves and range on his jumpshot. Mohamed Bamba (Fr.) blew up basketball social media with his monster dunk versus VCU. The 7-foot freshman for Texas has a 7-9 wingspan with impressive mobility. He has all the makings of a potential elite interior defender with offensive upside.</p>
<p>However, the best prospect in the 2018 draft does not play in the NCAA. That title belongs to Luka Doncic. Known simply as “Wonderboy” in Europe, Luka Doncic has taken the Spanish league (Liga ACB) by storm the past two seasons. At age 18, he is already the best player on Real Madrid and one of the best players on the continent.  Doncic is a 6’6 lead ball handler that possesses elite court vision. He is deadly off pick and roll often whipping cross court passes to open shooters. He is also deadly from three-point range himself, making two triples per game while shooting 35% from deep. There is no perfect comparison for Doncic, but he does remind me a little bit of James Harden in the sense that he is unstoppable off the pick and roll, creates for others at a high rate, and possesses a deadly step-back three. He pulled out all of his tricks during a monster game versus Olympiakos where he dropped 33 points:</p>

<p>So far in 12 games during the Euroleague, basketball’s version of the Champions League, Doncic is averaging 20 points (2nd in the competition), 6 rebounds and 4 assists per game. In 22 total games this season, Doncic is averaging 17.6 PPG, 6 RPG, and 4.3 APG while shooting 48% from the floor and 35% from three. These stats are impressive standing alone, but they become even more impressive considering that he is an 18-year-old kid playing against the best players Europe has to offer.</p>
<p>He also found success on the international stage. Playing alongside NBA star Goran Dragic, Doncic helped lead Slovenia to the 2017 Fiba EuroBasket Championship. Doncic averaged 14.3 PPG, 8.1 RPG, and 3.6 APG. He led the team in rebounds and was second in scoring and assists behind Dragic. Doncic was named to the All-Star five, the all-tournament team, alongside NBA players Pau Gasol, Goran Dragic, and Bogdan Bogdanovic. Doncic was named as one of the five best players in a tournament that included a deep field of NBA talent such as Dennis Schroder, Kristaps Porzingis, Evan Fournier, Jonas Valanciunas, Nikola Vucevic, Omri Casspi, Dario Saric, and Marc Gasol just to name a few.</p>
<p>However, Doncic is still being dismissed by many NBA fans as just another European prospect that will most likely be a bust. I’ve heard things such as, “Ricky Rubio played in the Spanish league at a young age and he didn’t turn out,” and “guys like this get hyped every season from Europe and they are always overrated.” This kid is different. He is unlike any European prospect that we have ever seen. He has dominated this season at age 18 in a league that is widely considered to be the best league in Europe, and he is likely the most accomplished 18-year-old in European basketball history.</p>
