<h1>The Future: MIN or PHI?</h1>
<p>Many questions have been asked about the Minnesota Timberwolves and Philadelphia 76ers for the past few years. While some of the questions, or compliments, have been positive, many have been negative for both sides. Both Philadelphia and Minnesota have taken different paths to their rebuilds, but yet both are still a year or two away from serious playoff contention. However, the month of January has been a revelation for both teams. Minnesota is 7-3 over their last ten games and sits just 3.5 games out of a playoff berth in the Western Conference. Philadelphia has also been on a tear, as they have won seven of their last ten games. This begs an important question; which team has the brighter future?</p>
<br>
<h4><b>The Case for Minnesota:</b></h4>

<p>The Timberwolves have not made the playoffs since the 2003-04 season, and for those of you counting at home, yes that is 12 seasons. Now I do not believe they’ll end the streak this season, but the month of January has been promising for the Wolves. Minnesota’s young core seems to finally be turning the proverbial corner in their individual and team development and also taking Tom Thibodeau’s teaching to heart. While they are no strangers to coming out flat, Minnesota has a real case to argue that they could be .500 this season.</p>
<br>
<p>Minnesota’s bench has been nothing short of terrible this season, and the young guns have had a hard time adjusting to clutch moments. These are some of Minnesota’s problems, however, these losses will help their growth in the future. While Minnesota sits 11 games under .500, very rarely do they get blown out. This late game experience will be vital to their future success, and also has been a great process for vetting out what this team still needs.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Area of concern:</b></h4>

<p><u>Bench Play:</u> Currently, Shabazz Muhammed is Minnesota’s only threat of the bench, averaging 8.7 PPG in just 19.0 MPG. With only one real scorer and other pieces who are not contributing, Minnesota has struggled to take or hold a lead with their bench on the court. Nemanja Bjelica has taken 3 or 4 steps backward this season and Kris Dunn still looks like a rookie. While Tyus Jones has been effective in short spurts, Thibodeau is reluctant to put him on the court on a nightly basis.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>The Case for Philadelphia:</b></h4>

<p>Joel "The Process" Embiid. Joel Embiid is well on his way to not being just a top 5 center in the league, but he also has the potential to crawl into the discussion of being one of the best players in the NBA very quickly. Embiid has slowly breathed life back into this franchise and has energized the fan base and players around him. When Ben Simmons returns from a foot injury, look out, this team may be scary.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Area for Concern:</b></h4>

<p><u>The Injury Bug:</u> There is going to be a bigger focus on injuries for Philly than the Wolves, however, the injury bug can strike at any time. Embiid, Simmons, Okafor and Noel have all missed extensive time throughout their respective careers. Embiid’s injury filled career has been well documented, Simmons has yet to play this season, Noel has had two knee injuries since missing his rookie year and Okafor missed the end of last season with a torn ligament in his knee.</p>
<br>
<p>While these injuries have been well documented, all of these players can go on to have long, successful careers in the NBA. Simmons should have an immediate impact on the franchise, similar to that of Embiid. If Simmons can develop a mid-range jump shot, he and Embiid will be a tough out in the coming seasons.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>How the verdict could change:</b></h4>

<p>The point guard position is the focal point of this debate. While Minnesota has Tyus Jones, Ricky Rubio, and Kris Dunn, none have proven to be the surefire point guard of the future. On the flip side, Philadelphia is currently rolling out a combination of TJ McConnell and Jerryd Bayless. The one downside to Philly’s run, they are hurting their draft stock. Philadelphia is a point guard away from being a playoff contender in the Eastern Conference, this much is evident. While Simmons may help take the load off the position when he returns, Markelle Fultz or Lonzo Ball would go a long way to helping this franchise in the future.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>The Verdict:</b></h4>

<p>While this is only the beginning of this debate, at this moment in time, the Minnesota Timberwolves have a brighter future than the 76ers. While some may disagree with this statement, Minnesota has played tough in the Western Conference and has battled night in and night out with every team they have faced. While Philly has been no slouch during this run, Minnesota has three different players who can take over at any juncture of the game. This ability, paired with Tom Thibodeau, could be a scary for the Western Conference in just a few short years.</p>
