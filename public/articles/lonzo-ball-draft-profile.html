<p>The former 2016 McDonald’s All-American turned in a solid freshman season at UCLA averaging 14.6 points, 7.6 assists, and 6 rebounds per game. He helped turn a UCLA team into a contender in the NCAA tournament. The year before Lonzo arrived, UCLA finished 15-17 with a 6-12 record in Pac-12 conference play. With help from T.J. Leaf, Ike Anigbogu, and Bryce Alford, Lonzo Ball helped UCLA go 31-5 and earn a three seed in the NCAA tournament. Now, Ball is the consensus #2 prospect in the 2017 NBA Draft, but there has been a lot of rumors surrounding him lately. First, there is Lonzo’s father, LaVar. LaVar has been a very outspoken guy in the media lately, and a lot of NBA executives think that he could be hurting his son’s future. Secondly, Lonzo reportedly came into his Lakers’ workout “out of shape” according to OC Register. Although Lonzo has many rumors surrounding him, he still has an undeniable knack for the game of basketball.

<h4><b>Strengths</b></h4>
<p>Lonzo Ball has many strengths. When fans and NBA experts watch his game, there are so many things that jump off the paper. The first aspect of Ball’s game that stands out is his passing ability. He dishes the ball out to teammates like LeBron James takes over closeout games. Lonzo Ball averaged 8.7 assists per 40 minutes. Ball puts the ball on point and on target. His passing ability is similar to that of Ricky Rubio, who always knows where his teammates want the ball. Lonzo Ball loves to get into transition after he grabs a defensive rebound. With his physical tools (6’6” with a 6'8.5” wingspan) and long open court strides, he can pull-up from three, or dish it off to a teammate to hit an open three. Lonzo Ball is also a terrific shooter from deep. He shot 41.2% from downtown in his freshman season at UCLA. Many fans and NBA executives are concerned about his unorthodox shot-form. The Sports Science below goes through why Lonzo’s shot may not be as much of a problem as some people think.</p>

<p>Lonzo Ball also has great instincts. Ball isn’t considered a great on-ball defender, and that is true, but Ball always seems to be one step ahead of everyone else on the court. Ball can sniff out a crosscourt pass and take off in transition. Ball’s instincts also help him on the offensive end. Ball can predict where a teammate will be and he can deliver a pass on target while looking away. One of the final strengths of Ball is his winning mentality. Ball has won wherever he has played. In his senior year at Chino Hills, he led the team to a 35-0 record and a state championship. In his freshman season at UCLA, he improved UCLA’s win total by 16 wins and got them back into the NCAA tournament. Ball knows how to win, and at his age, he is much more mature than other prospects in the 2017 NBA Draft.</p>

<h4><b>Weaknesses</b></h4>
<p>Although Lonzo Ball is the second best player in the 2017 NBA Draft, he does have some glaring holes that he will need to fill to succeed in the NBA. His man-to-man defense isn’t the best at this point in his career. Similar to his slow first step when driving to the hoop on the offensive end, opposing players have the chance to beat Ball on the defensive end with a quick step of their own. Another hole in Ball’s game is his ability to create in a halfcourt offense. Ball is terrific in the transition game, but when the game is slowed down, he has a hard time creating plays for himself and his teammates in the halfcourt. NBA executive aren’t sure about Ball’s pick-and-roll abilities at this point either. UCLA didn’t run many pick-and-rolls, but Ball will have to be able to run them in the NBA. </p>
<p>Another weakness in Ball’s offensive game is his streakiness. Lonzo Ball has the ability to go missing from game-to-game in the scoring category which can’t happen if he wants to be the star of a team. Take his 11-point performance early in the year against Washington State. The previous two games before the game against Washington State, Ball shot a combined 6-14 from beyond the arc, which is a 42.9% clip. Then, against Washington State, he shot 1-5 from three. Obviously, every shooter has an off night, but Lonzo Ball seemed to have more off nights from three than a #2 prospect should. He shot 1-5 from three again in the middle of the season against Arizona, and it seemed like UCLA never knew what Ball would give them from downtown. Fortunately for NBA teams, a lot of Lonzo’s weaknesses are fixable. With time he should be able to become more consistent from three. An NBA coach will be able to work with Ball on his pick-and-roll game, and as Ball gets older, he will become more physical and stronger.</p>

<h4><b>NBA Comparison</b></h4>
<p>Lonzo Ball is one of the most difficult players to find a comparison for within the 2017 NBA Draft class. He is so unique in his passing and shooting abilities. A player like Lonzo Ball doesn’t come along every day. Jason Kidd is an average comparison, but the two players still have very different games. Jason Kidd loved to get physical with opponents and get into passing lanes averaging 4.8 steals per 40 minutes in his freshman season in college. Ball averaged 2.1 steals per 40 minutes in his freshman season. Another comparison that comes up is Magic Johnson. Johnson said himself that he sees some of himself in Lonzo. But, Lonzo will be a much better three-point shooter than Magic. Johnson shot 30.3% from downtown in his career, which Ball should exceed rather easily. While there is no exact comparison to Lonzo Ball, the two names that come up the most are Jason Kidd and Magic Johnson.</p>
