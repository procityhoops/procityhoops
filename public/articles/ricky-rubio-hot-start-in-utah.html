<h1>Ricky Rubio's Hot Start in Utah</h1>

<p>Last offseason, one of the more under the radar moves came when the Minnesota Timberwolves traded Ricky Rubio to the Utah Jazz. At the time, the Jazz made the move in part because the team needed a starting point guard and also because Gordon Hayward was reportedly interested in playing with Rubio. Unfortunately for the Jazz, Hayward left town and joined the Boston Celtics.</p>
<p>Rubio has long been known as one of the worst shooting point guards in the NBA, and for the Jazz, that could have ended up being a problem since their biggest offensive threat had just left for Boston. However, the season has started out well for the Jazz and Rubio. The Jazz are off to a 5-3 start, good for sixth in the Western Conference. In addition, Ricky Rubio is leading the team in points, assists, and steals. In his time in Minnesota, he was known for his passing and great defense, but he was never known as a great scorer.</p>

<p>This season, Rubio is starting to turn the tide. While an eight-game sample size is not big, Rubio has still managed to shoot 43.7% from the field and 37.2% from three-point range. Both of those numbers are currently a career-high for the Spanish point guard. And what some people do not realize is that Rubio is also putting up the most shots per game that he ever has. So, Rubio is shooting a career-high from the field and from downtown while averaging four and three more shots per game from each spot respectively compared to last season.</p>

<p>Ricky Rubio has the Utah Jazz playing well, but will it continue? The Jazz were predicted by most to be fighting for the eighth seed in the stacked Western Conference. But, right now, they are looking much better than an eighth seed. With impressive wins over the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Portland Trail Blazers early in the season, the Jazz will look to stay hot behind their new scoring threat: Ricky Rubio.</p>
