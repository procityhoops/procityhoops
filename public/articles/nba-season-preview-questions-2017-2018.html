<p><b>Question from @JonHayungs: Will there be any surprise all-stars this year?</b></p>
<p>Answer: With the new NBA All-Star format, it is tough to predict who will make the cut because NBA players will be selecting the teams. Derrick Rose should be able to put up good numbers at the beginning of this season until Isaiah Thomas is back, so there is certainly a chance he could sneak into the game. Another player that could have a chance to make it if he stays healthy is Danilo Gallinari. Gallo has always been a solid player, but he has never been able to stay fully healthy. If he is able to stay healthy in Los Angeles, I think he could have a massive season.</p>
<p><b>Question from @AustinFarrell9: Will the new-look Wolves get lost in the shuffle with how good the Western Conference has become?</b></p>
<p>Answer: It is quite amazing that we are talking about a team with Jimmy Butler, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Andrew Wiggins getting lost in the shuffle, but it is certainly possible. With all the major moves that happened in the offseason, there are certainly going to be a number of teams to watch, but for most people, the Timberwolves will be on that list.</p>
<p><b>Question from @alex_malfa: Will Derrick Rose return to the Rose of old?</b></p>
<p>Answer: The answer is quite simple: if Rose stays healthy, he will be a big threat; if not, then it is a different story. Most people tend to forget that Rose had a very solid season for the Knicks last year, but because the team was not successful, he did not get noticed. Rose will certainly have a chance to impress right out of the gate since Isaiah Thomas will be out until January with an injury. So, to answer the question, if Rose stays healthy, he could be in line for an all-star caliber season.</p>
<p><b>Question from @JeanLuisPeaPer1: Do you think the Boston Celtics can beat the Cleveland Cavaliers?</b></p>
<p>Answer: First off, in basketball, anyone can win on any given night, so it is certainly possible the Celtics could dethrone the Cavs this season, but I do not think that will happen. While the Celtics added Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward this offseason, the Cavaliers added Isaiah Thomas, Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, and Jae Crowder. And oh yeah, they still have LeBron James.</p>
<p><b>Question from @KingLBJ19: Will the Warriors repeat?</b></p>
<p>Answer: While it might not be the most popular answer, I do not believe the Warriors will repeat. Yes, they still have Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green, but enough teams stacked up this offseason with one goal in mind: to dethrone the defending champs.</p>
<p><b>Question from @cnieberding12: How will Yogi Ferrell and Dennis Smith Jr. blend, and will Seth Curry still fit when he returns?</b></p>
<p>Answer: First off, Seth Curry will always fit on an NBA team with how the league is trending today. He is a three-point assassin and every team needs one of those. As for Yogi Ferrell and Dennis Smith Jr., I think it will take them some time to learn how to play off each other, but in the end, it will all work out for Dallas. Both Ferrell and Smith Jr. are capable of playing off the ball, and I think they will compliment each other very well.</p>
