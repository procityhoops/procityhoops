<h1>Timberwolves: Playoffs or Bust?</h1>

<p>When the Minnesota Timberwolves open up the 2017-18 season in San Antonio on October 18th, they will have a very different look. The Timberwolves will only have six players from last seasons roster return this year, unless Shabazz Muhammad decides to return on a veterans minimum deal before the start of the season. Although the Wolves will only be returning six players from last years roster, it may not be the worst case scenario. Minnesota has not made the playoffs since the 2003-04 season, and they were just 31-51 last season, 13th in the Western Conference.</p>
<p>The young Wolves team was projected to make a big jump last season when new coach Tom Thibodeau was hired. However, that was not the case. The Wolves struggled early, especially on the defensive side of the ball. They started playing well in the middle of the season trying to make a late playoff push, but in the end, it was all for naught. Now, the Minnesota Timberwolves are coming off one of their most important offseasons in recent history that saw the team make a load of changes.</p>
<p>The first change, and biggest, came on the night of the 2017 NBA Draft. Leading up to the draft, there was some buzz that the Timberwolves could look to move out of the seventh overall pick, but nobody expected a blockbuster deal to happen. Just moments before the draft opened, it was announced that the Timberwolves had shipped out the seventh pick, Zach LaVine, and Kris Dunn to the Chicago Bulls for Jimmy Butler and the 16th overall selection in the draft that night, which they used to select Justin Patton. NBA fans around the world were in awe. Wolves fans, accustomed to progressing players and trading away stars, were mostly excited that they were finally on the receiving end of a star being traded. Butler, one of the top two-way players in the league, played for Tom Thibodeau for four seasons before the Bulls let Thibs go. Butler will make an immediate impact especially on the defensive end of the court, where the Wolves struggled mightily last season.</p>
<p>The next move the Timberwolves made this offseason was trading away longtime point guard Ricky Rubio for a first-round pick in 2018. Rubio had run the Wolves’ backcourt for the previous six seasons, and he was loved by Wolves fans. Getting rid of Rubio meant Minnesota needed to add a new starting point guard. And, on the first day of free agency they did just that inking Jeff Teague to a three-year, $57 million deal. Fans did not understand the move to trade away a point guard who was just getting familiar with the system, but the move needed to be done. While I believe Ricky Rubio will be the point guard he was in the second half of last season, he could not shoot, and that definitely hurt the Wolves the last six seasons, and when they get back to the playoffs, they will need a shooting point guard. While Teague is just a 35.5% career three-point shooter, that is four percent higher than Rubio’s 31.5% career three-point percentage. Teague will also give Karl-Anthony Towns more freedom on the block. Instead of teams being able to double Towns down low, they will have to stay near Teague on the perimeter, and if they do not, Towns will kick it out to Teague and he will make them pay from downtown.</p>

<p>The final two major moves the Wolves made this offseason was to address their depth. They first inked Taj Gibson to a two-year deal, then they signed Jamal Crawford to a two-year contract using their “Room Exception.” Gibson will bring the team a much needed veteran mentor. Gibson played with Thibodeau in Chicago, so he knows his system very well, which will be very helpful for the young guys. Jamal Crawford will immediately address the Timberwolves bench problems. The Timberwolves ranked dead last in bench scoring last season, and Jamal Crawford is one of the best bench scorers in the entire league to shore up that weakness for Minnesota.</p>
<p>With all the moves the Timberwolves have already made this offseason, they still have moves to make. They still lack three-point shooting and wing depth. They have reportedly been recruiting Shabazz Muhammad to come back, even though they just have the veterans minimum to offer. They also have interest in former Wolf Dante Cunningham according to Darren Wolfson of KSTP. Both players would be terrific gets on the veterans minimum contract, but it is more likely that they will take more money elsewhere. Other names that are more of a possibility include Anthony Morrow, Mike Dunleavy Jr., and Aaron Brooks. Dunleavy Jr. and Brooks both played for Thibodeau in Chicago. Morrow is looking for a new home after having his worst season of his nine-year NBA career last season. Morrow is reportedly interested in signing with Minnesota on a veterans minimum contract, but the Timberwolves are holding out to see if Muhammad or Cunningham will come before considering Morrow.</p>
<p>With all the big moves the Timberwolves have made this offseason, most NBA experts are putting the team in the middle of the Western Conference Playoffs as a four or five seed. So, that bring up the question: Is this year playoffs or bust for the Wolves? In short, the answer is yes. The Timberwolves have not made the playoffs since 2004, thirteen seasons ago. They finally have the talent and coaching stability to get back to the postseason. With Jimmy Butler, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Andrew Wiggins leading the way, there is no saying on what the limit for the Timberwolves is, only time will tell.</p>
