<p>The news is breaking that the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets have agreed to terms on a trade. The Lakers will be sending D’Angelo Russell and Timofey Mozgov to the Nets in exchange for Brook Lopez and the 27th selection in the NBA Draft on Thursday. At first glance, it looks like a great trade for both teams. The Lakers get to shed $54 million left on Mozgov’s contract, and they gain a top-seven center in the league. The Lakers also get to add another player in the NBA Draft. They now own the #2, #27, and #28 picks on Thursday evening. For the Nets, they add a young Russell who will help start their rebuild. Russell should put up big numbers and will be able to do whatever he wants. Stay tuned to our twitter for the most recent news on the NBA offseason.</p>
