<p>On October 25th, 2015, the NBA community was struck. The league learned of the passing of Philip “Flip” Saunders, who had been diagnosed with cancer (Hodgkin's lymphoma) just two and a half months prior. Flip Saunders was in the middle of transforming the Timberwolves into what they were a decade and a half ago: an NBA powerhouse. The last time Minnesota made the playoffs was in the 2003-2004 season when Saunders was the head coach. Saunders and Kevin Garnett led the team to an appearance in the Western Conference Finals that year before they were knocked off by Kobe Bryant and the Lakers in six games. After that defeat in the Western Conference Finals, the Timberwolves were not able to regroup, and they haven’t made the playoffs since. Flip left the team the year after the Wolves were defeated by the Lakers in the Western Conference Finals. He went on to coach the Detroit Pistons and the Washington Wizards, but there was no place like Minnesota to Flip. The Timberwolves competed for a playoff spot for a couple more seasons, but in the summer of 2007, the team traded former MVP, Kevin Garnett, to the Boston Celtics. This put the Wolves into a rebuild that they wouldn’t be able to get out of for many years. After Garnett left, the team went through six straight seasons of horrendous basketball. The best winning percentage in that six-year stretch was in the 2011-2012 lockout-shortened season when Ricky Rubio finally made his way over to play in the NBA. However, even though that was the Wolves best winning percentage in the last six years, they still only won 39.4% of their games that season. The next season (2012-2013) was supposed to finally be the one that saw the Minnesota Timberwolves make the playoffs again. However, injuries cut the Wolves’ playoff hopes off, and they were left in the NBA Draft Lottery once again. Now, this is where Flip Saunders comes back into the picture.</p>
<p>After the 2012-2013 season, Glen Taylor (Wolves owner) made the move to hire Flip Saunders as the President of Basketball Operations for the Minnesota Timberwolves. Wolves fans were excited since Saunders had been around in the glory days of the Wolves. Saunders didn’t waste any time, and he got right to work on his new job with the Wolves. The first task that Saunders faced that offseason was the 2013 NBA Draft. The Wolves owned the ninth pick and had a chance to add a young talent to surround an already strong core. However, Saunders traded the ninth pick to the Utah Jazz for the 14th and 21st selections on the same night. He used the 14th pick on Shabazz Muhammad and selected Gorgui Dieng with the 21st pick. Although it was a risk, for Saunders and the Wolves, it was a risk worth taking. His next goal in the summer of 2013 was to find a shooter to put next to Kevin Love and Ricky Rubio. Saunders aggressively pursued many shooters in free agency and ended up signing sharpshooter Kevin Martin to a contract with the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Wolves still had coach Rick Adelman on board for the 2013-2014 season, and they finally looked like they were ready to rejoin the NBA Western Conference Playoffs.</p>
<p>The season started off great for the Wolves. They opened the season with three straight wins and ended up having a 5-2 record through the first seven games. Unfortunately, they were not able to sustain that effort. Minnesota went up-and-down the rest of the season hovering around .500 until the very end. They finished 40-42, putting them tenth in the Western Conference but nine games out of the playoffs. The Wolves didn’t accomplish their goals in the 2013-2014 season, and because of that, Flip Saunders had a new problem on his hands: Kevin Love wanted out of Minnesota.</p>
<p>Through the 2013-2014 season, Kevin Love had spent his entire career in Minnesota. He came over in a draft night trade with the Memphis Grizzlies and blossomed into an all-star in front of Wolves nation. However, after not making the playoffs in his six-year career in the land of 10,000 lakes, Love wanted a taste of winning.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>Going into the 2014 NBA Draft, NBA experts assumed that Saunders would hold onto Love on draft night and trade him at a later date, which is what he did. However, what many NBA experts did not see coming as the draft approached: the Cleveland Cavaliers jumping from their projected ninth position in the 2014 NBA Draft, all the way up to the top pick thanks to the NBA Draft Lottery. The Wolves owned the 13th pick in the 2014 NBA Draft, and Flip Saunders selected high-flyer Zach LaVine. LaVine was seen as a high-risk, high-reward type of player. His athletic ability could not be matched, but the other parts of his game were supposed to take time to develop. Of course, with the first pick in the 2014 NBA Draft, the Cleveland Cavaliers selected Andrew Wiggins, the consensus top pick dating back to high school. The selection of Andrew Wiggins would soon set up the biggest deal that Flip Saunders would make as the President of the Minnesota Timberwolves.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2014, the best player in the NBA was set to hit free agency: LeBron James. James left the Cavaliers in the summer of 2010, but now, he was once again a free agent, and he was reportedly considering going back home. After thinking through his decision, LeBron James came to the decision that he had unfinished business in Cleveland, and he announced his decision to return to the city he loved. This move would set up the entire domino effect of Andrew Wiggins becoming a member of the Wolves, and Kevin Love becoming a member of the Cavs.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>After LeBron James returned to Cleveland, he obviously wanted to win. In their current state, the Cavaliers did not have a championship caliber team, and GM David Griffin knew that. The team needed a power forward and a veteran to solidify themselves as a serious title contender. Fortunately for the Cavs, Timberwolves forward, Kevin Love, was available. Flip had a choice. He could either trade Kevin Love and get a handful of valuable assets in return to set the team up for the future, or he could hang onto Love and lose him the summer after in free agency. Flip chose the first option. He saw great potential in players like Andrew Wiggins and Anthony Bennett and decided to flip Kevin Love for those players. He also acquired Thaddeus Young from the Philadelphia 76ers, a third team in the deal. Flip Saunders had chosen a direction for the Wolves: another rebuild. While it might not have been the most popular decision, it was the right one. With young players like Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine, there was no saying what heights the Wolves could reach in the future.</p>
<p>The summer of 2014 also brought Flip Saunders back into coaching. He decided that he wanted to take the reigns of the head coaching position after Rick Adelman went into retirement. Flip wanted to implement his own system and develop his players himself on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>The Timberwolves had a rough 2014-2015 season, to say the least. Minnesota finished 16-66, and the team lost 15 straight games at one point in the season. However, not everything was terrible for the Wolves during that season. At the NBA Trade Deadline, Saunders made a move to re-acquire Kevin Garnett and bring him in to mentor the young players. It was a terrific strategy on the part of Flip Saunders. Garnett was reaching the end of his NBA career, but he would still be a great voice for the young Wolves to hear and learn from. Flip had to give up Thaddeus Young in the trade for Garnett, but Young was expected to leave the team in free agency the upcoming season anyway, so it was not a terrible loss. Another bright spot during the 2014-2015 season was the development of the young players. Andrew Wiggins was 2015 NBA Rookie of the Year, and Zach LaVine made major strides each week of the season, in addition to being the dunk champ at NBA All-Star Weekend.</p>
<p>At the end of the season, the Minnesota Timberwolves found themselves in a familiar position. They were once again headed to the NBA Draft Lottery, and this time, they were projected to get the top pick. And for once, the Minnesota Timberwolves did not move down in the lottery, and they landed the top pick in the NBA Draft. To say the least, Flip Saunders was pretty happy.</p>

<p>Saunders and the Wolves went through the entire draft process before deciding to select Karl-Anthony Towns out of Kentucky with the top pick in the 2015 NBA Draft. Towns was said to be a franchise-changing player, but most NBA experts thought he would take some time to develop. Saunders also traded the team’s two second round picks to move back into the first round and select hometown kid, Tyus Jones. Jones played high school ball in Apple Valley, located in Minnesota, and Flip Saunders had always been a fan. After the draft, the Wolves turned to free agency where Saunders wanted to bring in more veterans to lead and guide the Wolves. He brought in veteran point guard, Andre Miller, to provide leadership to Tyus Jones and Zach LaVine. He also brought in Tayshaun Prince, who Saunders coached in his time with the Pistons. After free agency, the Wolves had a veteran leader for each main group of players on the team: guards, forwards, and KG doing his work with the big men.</p>
<p>After free agency had gone through its main stages, Wolves fans heard the news that Flip Saunders had been diagnosed with cancer. Saunders was expected to miss part of the upcoming season, but he was also expected to make a recovery and continue his duties as the Minnesota Timberwolves President of Basketball Operations.</p>
<p>As the weeks went on, the Timberwolves opened training camp with interim head coach, Sam Mitchell, running the show. The Timberwolves were expecting an increase in their win total from the previous season with the continued development of their young players and the addition of veteran players in free agency. However, just three days before the season was expected to open, tragedy struck. Flip Saunders had unexpectedly passed away from cancer. The team and the entire NBA was hit hard. Saunders had been a great figure in the league for many years, and he truly cared about everyone, and that was proven following his death. Saunders got described as iconic, passionate, creative, innovative, a lifer, humorous, and never changing by coaches, executives, and players around the league. It was clear that Flip had a strong impact on anybody that he ever met.</p>

<br>
<p>Although their leader had just passed away, the Wolves knew they had a job to do: make Flip proud. In advance of opening day in the 2015-2016 season, Andrew Wiggins said, “He had a vision, and we are trying to make that vision live on forever. Every day, every game, every practice, we play for Flip.” The Wolves were committed to playing for Flip and making him proud of the team that he constructed.</p>
<p>The Timberwolves competed hard the entire 2015-2016 season and finished with a record of 29-53, 13 more wins than the season before. Saunders’ top pick, Karl-Anthony Towns, was the unanimous NBA Rookie of the Year winner. He was just the fifth unanimous selection in NBA history joining Damian Lillard, Blake Griffin, David Robinson, and Ralph Simpson. In addition to Towns, Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine also made great strides in their sophomore seasons. Both players saw an increase in points per game from the prior season. With Towns, LaVine, and Wiggins leading the way, there was no saying on how far the Wolves could go.</p>
<p>After the 2015-2016 season, Glen Taylor let go the current Timberwolves coaching and front office staff. He brought on Tom Thibodeau to be their new President of Basketball Operations and head coach. Thibodeau hired Scott Layden as the new General Manager of the Wolves, and it seemed like the Wolves were committed to getting back to the postseason.</p>
<p>Thibodeau and the Wolves got right to work. They selected Kris Dunn, a point guard out of Providence, with the fifth pick in the 2016 NBA Draft, and they added veterans like Cole Aldrich and Brandon Rush in free agency. Wolves fans were ready to win, and some NBA outlets were predicting that the Wolves would get back to where they had not been since the 2003-2004 season: the playoffs.</p>
<p>However, the 2016-2017 season did not go as planned for the Wolves. They finished the season with a record of 31-51, only a two-win improvement from the previous season. Worse yet, Zach LaVine, who was putting together a career year, went down with a torn ACL in February of 2017. The Timberwolves had not accomplished what they wanted to in the 2016-2017 season, but in all fairness, it was their first season under Thibs. But, after the season, the Wolves realized that their most important offseason in recent memory was right ahead of them.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Timberwolves moved back one spot in the NBA Draft Lottery and held the seventh pick going into the 2017 NBA Draft. Ever since he got the Wolves job, Tom Thibodeau has been interested in trading for Jimmy Butler. Thibodeau coached Butler for four seasons in Chicago and turned him into one of the best two-way players in the NBA. On the night of the 2017 NBA Draft, Thibodeau used one of Flip’s guys, Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn, and the seventh pick to trade for Jimmy Butler and the 16th selection in the draft. Thibodeau got his guy, and the Wolves got their all-star. However, the Timberwolves were not done making moves in the early part of the NBA offseason. Last Friday, the Minnesota Timberwolves traded longtime starting point guard, Ricky Rubio, to the Utah Jazz. The Timberwolves got a protected 2018 first round pick in the deal for Rubio, but it was a move to open up space to sign free agents and improve the roster. On the opening night of free agency, the Wolves agreed to a contract with Jeff Teague, who played for the Indiana Pacers last season. The Wolves also went and got another Thibodeau guy on the second day of free agency when they agreed to sign Taj Gibson to a two-year, $28 million contract. While the Wolves are still in the market for a shooter, after ranking last in three-pointers made during the 2016-2017 season, they have certainly turned into a threat in the Western Conference.</p>
<p>While Tom Thibodeau has certainly put his handprints all over the current Timberwolves’ team, how was he able to do that? With Flip’s assets and his vision that he put into place. Flip took a chance on Zach LaVine. LaVine has turned into a developing all-star in the NBA, which allowed Thibodeau to flip him, Kris Dunn, and the seventh pick for one of the best two-way players in today’s NBA. Flip took a chance on Gorgui Dieng. Dieng was the Wolves’ starting power forward last season, and he is projected to play a big role either starting or coming off the bench again in this upcoming season. Flip took his guy in Tyus Jones. Unless the Timberwolves sign another point guard in free agency, Tyus will be the Timberwolves’ backup point guard next season. And finally, Flip traded for and drafted two of the Wolves’ most prized possessions at the moment: Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns. While Flip Saunders is no longer around, fans around the NBA can see his vision coming to life. Barring the unexpected, the Minnesota Timberwolves will be back where they belong next season: the playoffs.</p>
