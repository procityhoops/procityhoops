<h1>Celtics looking to add an All-Star?</h1>
<p>In the last two weeks, the Boston Celtics were defeated by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Finals, and they obtained the #1 pick at the draft lottery. However, according to CSNNEâ€™s A. Sherrod Blakely, the Celtics are pursuing another big move this offseason. Blakely reports that Danny Ainge wants to add an all-star frontcourt player.
<p>Last season, the Boston Celtics often played Al Horford and Amir Johnson down low, so it is clear that there is room for improvement. Two players that are free agents this summer and fit the all-star criteria include Blake Griffin and Gordon Hayward. It might be difficult for the Celtics to pry these all-stars away from their current teams, but it is clear that the Celtics will once again be in rumors all offseason.</p>
