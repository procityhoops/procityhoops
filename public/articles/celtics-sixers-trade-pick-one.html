<p>Late Friday afternoon, many NBA outlets reported that the Sixers and the Celtics were in “deep talks” regarding the #1 pick in the 2017 NBA Draft. It was also reported that Markelle Fultz would not be going to his second meeting in Boston, and now, he’s meeting with Philly on Saturday evening. If the trade happens, Adrian Wojnarowski reports that the Sixers would have to deal the third pick this year and at least the Lakers pick in 2018. At this point, it’s been reported that no players would be involved in the trade. Woj also reports that a 2021 first-round pick could be in play going to Boston. The consensus top pick, Markelle Fultz is projected to be a star in the NBA, so why would Boston and the Sixers make the trade?</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Why Boston does the trade</b></h4>
<p>The Boston Celtics would make this trade in order to add on to their already heaping pile of assets. The Celtics made the Eastern Conference Finals this year, and now they have the #1 pick in the most loaded draft in recent memory. The Celtics have been rumored to have an interest in Gordon Hayward and Blake Griffin this summer and moving from #1 to #3 would free up a little more space to sign them. The Celtics are also said to have an extreme interest in Josh Jackson. The forward out of Kansas has caught the eyes of Danny Ainge and Celtics’ personnel in recent weeks. The Celtics feel like they would still have a chance to get Josh Jackson at pick #3 and stockpile future assets. Acquiring the Lakers unprotected pick in 2018 would also be very valuable for the team. The Celtics would gain another asset that they could attach in a possible trade for Jimmy Butler or Paul George. Many NBA executives believe that this is the summer when Danny Ainge wants to bring in the final pieces for a championship team. LeBron James is potentially going to LA next summer, and if Danny Ainge can put together a team to challenge LeBron again this year, they would be free sailing once LeBron moves out of the East to play with his buddies in LA.</p>
<p>At first glance, the trade might not seem like a good idea for Boston since they would be passing on one of the best prospects in the last decade. But, if Josh Jackson is their guy anyway, moving down and gaining extra assets in the process seems like a good idea.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Why Philadelphia does the trade</b></h4>
<p>The Philadelphia 76ers have been horrible since they last made the playoffs in the 2011-2012 NBA season. Last year, the Sixers finally made some strides. Joel “Trust the process” Embiid gave Sixer fans hope for the future. Last year’s #1 pick Ben Simmons was out for the season and didn’t get any time on the court. But, with 28 wins last year (18 more than the previous year), the Sixers seem to have a great foundation. Ben Simmons is expected to make his NBA debut this season next to Joel Embiid and Dario Saric. Trading for the #1 pick and selecting Markelle Fultz would just add to the already tremendous young core of the Sixers. Markelle Fultz is as sure of a thing that there is in the 2017 NBA Draft. Fultz averaged 23.2 points and 5.9 assists per game in his freshman season at Washington. Adding Fultz would allow Philly to keep Ben Simmons at the small forward position and give them a core of Fultz, Embiid, Simmons, and Saric. That would be as good of a young core as a team could ask for.</p>
<p>Giving up the 2018 unprotected Lakers pick isn’t ideal for the Sixers, but when they have a chance to get the top prospect in the 2017 NBA Draft, it’s well worth it. The Sixers have a chance to get something that very few teams can say they have: three projected future All-Stars in their starting lineup that are all under 23 years old.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Wrapup</b></h4>
<p>Both the Sixers and the Celtics have a chance to pull off something remarkable in this trade. The Celtics would continue to pile up assets to possibly eventually trade for a star, and the Sixers would be able to pair the top prospect in the Draft with an already talented, young core in Philly.</p>
