<h1>Kristaps Porzingis Landing Spots</h1>

<p>In a shocking development, the New York Knicks are reportedly taking calls on Kristaps Porzingis. While Phil Jackson’s tenure has been much maligned, the sole highlight of his time in the Big Apple was drafting the 7’3” Latvian. While the Knicks may be taking calls on Porzingis, it is important to note that the asking price is extremely high and a deal is not likely at this point.</p>
<h3>Potential Destinations:</h3>
<h4><b>Boston Celtics</b></h4>
<p>BOS receives: Kristaps Porzingis, Courtney Lee <br>
NYK receives: Jaylen Brown, Terry Rozier, #3 pick in the 2017 NBA Draft, 2018 first round pick differential (either LAL or BKN pick).</p>
<br>
<p>In this hypothetical scenario, Boston receives a coveted big man to pair next to Al Horford who is a perfect balance of talent for now and later. Boston would pair Porzingis next to Al Horford, and they may very well make a run at the number one seed again this upcoming season. Pair that with signing Gordon Hayward, or doubling down and trading for Jimmy Butler and the Cleveland Cavaliers will have to take notice.</p>
<p>In Jaylen Brown, New York receives another potential star to build around as well as a potential sixth man of the year (yes, you read that right) in Terry Rozier. The real prize is the number three pick in the NBA Draft on Thursday. This year’s draft is very deep, and the third pick could net you a star. In addition to the pick this year, another potential top-five pick next year adds to the Knicks value.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Phoenix Suns</b></h4>
<p>PHX receives: Kristaps Porzingis <br>
NYK receives: Devin Booker, Dragen Bender</p>
<br>
<p>Phoenix reportedly turned down an offer earlier today from the Knicks surrounding Devin Booker and the number four pick for Porzingis. While the asking price may be high, adding Porzingis to Eric Bledsoe could be a potentially enticing option for free agents such as Andre Igoudala and Gordon Hayward. What Phoenix loses in Booker they gain by getting back Porzingis. This trade may seem heavy, but Porzingis is well worth the former #12 pick in the draft.</p>
<p>While losing Kristaps Porzingis would be hard, New York could do much worse than adding Devin Booker. Booker’s ability to fill it up on the offensive side of the ball should mesh well with Carmelo Anthony as well as give Booker more room on the offensive end. Bender, who had a disappointing rookie year, was compared to Porzingis in the pre-draft process last year and offers a wealth of upside if the Knicks can find it.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Minnesota Timberwolves</b></h4>
<p>MIN receives: Kristaps Porzingis, Courtney Lee <br>
NYK receives: Ricky Rubio, Zach Lavine, #7 pick in the 2017 NBA Draft.</p>
<br>
<p>Can you imagine a scenario with both Karl-Anthony Towns and Kristaps Porzingis in the same frontcourt? What the Timberwolves lack on offense is shooting, Porzingis fixes that. What the Timberwolves lack on defense? Well, besides everything, a true rim protector. While losing Lavine, Rubio, and whoever is drafted at #7 would be a tough hit, Zach Lavine is due a massive contract extension coming off an ACL tear, and they do not need another 19 or 20-year-old piece. New York has been interested in Rubio for some time, and this trade helps both teams.</p>
<p>Zach Lavine, coming off a torn ACL, offers the Knicks a potential star if he can regain his pre-injury form. Ricky Rubio and the Knicks have been connected since the Wolves drafted Rubio in 2009, and the #7 pick additionally offers a wealth of upside. If the reported offer with the Suns is true, this price would make sense, and it would be beneficial for both teams.</p>
