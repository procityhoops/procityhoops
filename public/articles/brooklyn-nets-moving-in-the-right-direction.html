<h1>The Brooklyn Nets are moving in the right direction</h1>

<p>Two out of eleven. That’s how many winning seasons the Nets (Brooklyn and New Jersey) have had since 2006-2007. When the Nets relocated from New Jersey to Brooklyn, they were expecting to usher in a new era of winning. They became a quick fan favorite and GM Billy King (who was massively under qualified, but that’s a discussion for another time) had a trigger finger on the trade block. To put it lightly, the Nets were focused on the short-term. However, the win now mentality that showed success in the past was not harnessed correctly by Brooklyn. <b>“Today, the basketball gods smiled on the Nets”</b> read the headline. The infamous trade that sent Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Jason Terry to Brooklyn in exchange for a plethora of picks and washed up players is now well known by everyone as perhaps one of if not the worst trade in NBA history.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today. There is new front office management, Kenny Atkinson is developing what little young talent the Nets own, and Jay-Z no longer sits courtside. Yesterday the Nets made a surprising move that was not being reported on prior to it happening. Brooklyn sent a package of Brook Lopez and the 27th overall pick in Thursday’s draft in exchange for the Lakers’ D’Angelo Russell and Timofey Mozgov. While Mozgov’s large contract is unappealing, it was worth it to land a young guard with star potential. Although it is still recent, many scouts and analysts are labeling the Nets as winners of the trade. While it may hurt to see Brook Lopez, the face of the franchise for years sent to another team, fans of Brooklyn should be excited with this move. D’Angelo Russell hasn’t exactly lived up to expectations, but he had games last season with scoring outbursts of 40 points or more. Under coach Kenny Atkinson, a coach that specializes in developing young talent, Russell’s game should be able to evolve. Another big reason that Russell was traded was his immaturity on and off the court. Off the court, Russell made some progress this season and stayed out of the public eye as best as he could. On the court, however, he still showed lapses in his game when he wasn’t being given the ball. This trade to a bottom-dwelling team will either humble him or make him worse, it remains to be seen. Despite all this, when given the option to be the main guy on a team, his scoring ability on the court should be able to thrive. It’s going to be very exciting to see him lead a team and usher Brooklyn into a new era.</p>
<p>Despite their progress, this is still going to be a slow process. Brooklyn doesn’t own a first-round pick until 2019, and their pick which belongs to Boston will likely end up in the top five again next season. The Nets need to keep developing the young talent they have. While there isn’t a lot of young players here, the ones they have showed promise last season. With the talents of Caris LaVert and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, the Nets do have some hope for their future. Brooklyn needs to keep trading their remaining assets for draft picks. With one of the deepest drafts in memory this year, even low first round or second round picks posses a lot of talent. When you look down their roster, there aren’t a lot of names that hold value. The first name on the block should be Sean Kilpatrick. One of the only bright spots on the team last season, the guard from Cincinnati is already 27 years old. His value may be at its highest right now, and he likely won’t be part of their future moving forward. If Kilpatrick can land the Nets a late first round pick, it would be huge for Brooklyn going forward.</p>
<p>The Nets have been the laughing stock of the NBA for a few years now, and they finally have an opportunity to change that. All signs are finally starting to point in the right direction for this team, and with any luck, the basketball gods will smile down on them again.</p>
