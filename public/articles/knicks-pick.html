<p>On June 22nd, the New York Knicks will be making their first selection of the night at pick eight. However, the Knicks may not be done in the first round after their first pick. Ian Begley reports that the New York Knicks will work out Justin Jackson. Jackson has been a consensus mid-first round pick, and the Knicks likely would not use #8 on him. Begley also reports that there has been talk in the Knicks organization about possibly acquiring an extra first round pick. So, expect to hear more rumblings about the Knicks possibly making a move to get a second first round pick in the 2017 NBA Draft.</p>
