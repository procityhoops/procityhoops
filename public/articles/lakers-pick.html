<h1>What should the Lakers do with the second pick?</h1>
<p>The question of what the Lakers should do this offseason varies amongst numerous circles. Lonzo Ball is the hometown kid with an outspoken father who has been groomed to be a Laker since the day he laced up his first pair of sneakers. While Ball’s father may be outspoken, it is likely that it is free marketing for the “Big Baller Brand”. Lavar Ball has said he will not get involved with the Lakers like he did not get involved with UCLA. Steve Alford, the men’s basketball coach at UCLA, also relayed the same information this week. He said that Lavar Ball did not attend any practices, and he did not call with opinions.</p>
<p>De’Aaron Fox, Josh Jackson, and Jayson Tatum may tempt the Lakers at #2, but only Fox should be given serious consideration on draft night. Paul George seems destined to come home next offseason, which would be offset by picking either Tatum or Jackson. Fox absolutely exposed Ball in both of their meetings this season, capped with his 39-point performance in the NCAA tournament.</p>

<h4><b>The Pick: Lonzo Ball, G, UCLA</b></h4>
<p>Fox’s ability to penetrate the lane and involve his teammates in the offense is second to none in this draft, but his playmaking ability does not match that of Ball’s. Lonzo has the ability to involve his teammates in the offense much like Jason Kidd did when he was in his prime. While Ball may have what appears to be a “broken” jumper, he shot just above 40% from deep last season. Pairing Ball with D’Angelo Russell on the wing should work wonders for the Lakers as they push into the Magic Johnson era with a trio of young guns in Ball, Russell, and Ingram.</p>
