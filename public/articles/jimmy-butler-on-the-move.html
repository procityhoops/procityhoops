<p>Wow. What a crazy five minutes that NBA fans just experienced on Twitter. Within five minutes, top NBA reporters broke that the Timberwolves, Celtics, Suns, and Cavaliers have an interest in trading for Jimmy Butler. According to Adrian Wojnarowski, the Bulls asking price for Butler hasn’t gone down, but teams may be willing to pay a high price.</p>
<p>If you recall, the Timberwolves and Bulls were in talks on a Jimmy Butler trade around this time last season. The trade would have been centered on Kris Dunn. Now, the talks have begun yet again. Don’t be surprised if the talks involve Dunn, once again, and the seventh overall selection in the 2017 NBA Draft. For the Cavaliers, they have now been linked to Paul George and Jimmy Butler in the last two days. The Cavaliers would have to get a third team involved in a Jimmy Butler deal because if the Bulls trade Butler, they would likely want picks and prospects in return. The Suns’ ownership would like the team to start making a case for the playoffs. Their ownership wants to stop rebuilding and start winning immediately. They have an interest in Butler, but a more likely scenario would be them helping the Cavs as a third team in a Butler deal and getting Kevin Love. As for the Celtics, they have the most assets to offer out of any of these four teams, but the question is: will they offer them? Danny Ainge has seemed content on keeping their assets and even adding to them. With this breaking news occurring three days before the NBA Draft, keep your eyes on our Twitter for the most recent updates.</p>
