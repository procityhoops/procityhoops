<h1>Kyrie Irving vs Steph Curry Debate</h1>
<p>Game seven of the 2016 NBA Finals. With just over a minute left in regulation, the score is tied 89-89. The pass is inbounded to Kyrie Irving. Steph Curry is guarding Irving man to man. Irving sets up the offense, dribbles to the right, and puts up a contested three. “It’s good! Kyrie Irving from downtown!”</p>

<p>This is the shot that solidified Kyrie Irving as the most clutch player in the NBA last season. Irving was tasked with making the most meaningful shot in the Finals, and he drained it. What everyone forgets about is the player that played perfect defense on that play, Steph Curry. Irving has the ability to break down a defense with his handle and then score with his deadly jumper or finish at the hoop with his unmatched layup ability. Curry can light up a scoreboard with ease thanks to his shooting ability from beyond-the-arc, and distribute the ball across the floor with ease. So which one do you want on your team?</p>
<br>
<h4><b>The case for Steph Curry:</b></h4>
<p>Steph Curry is a two-time MVP award winner and an NBA Finals champion. Last year, he led his team to the greatest regular season ever, finishing with a record breaking 73-9 record. Curry is also the face of the change in the sport of basketball. With his tendency to pull up from near half-court and hit a three-pointer, he has inspired thousands of basketball players to focus on their three-point shooting. However, it’s not only his shooting ability that makes Curry valuable to a team. Curry averaged 25.3 PPG, 6.6 APG, and 4.5 RPG in the 2016 regular season. His playmaking ability has grown to the point where he has to be included in the conversation of the top five distributors in the NBA. However, Curry does have one evident weakness in his game, his physicality. While it doesn’t directly hurt him, it does give his defenders a spot to focus on and attempt to expose while guarding him. The style of Curry’s game makes it so he isn’t truly affected by this though.</p>
<p>Boston Celtics star Isaiah Thomas puts it well when describing why it’s so hard to guard Curry, saying: “With Steph, you’re always guessing. That’s what makes him so dangerous.” Thomas went on to further illustrate his point: “Everything he does depends on what the defender is doing. So when he’s coming at you, if you’re afraid of the three — which you should be — and you give him too much space, he’ll knock it down. If you play too far up on the three, he’ll take you off the dribble. If he beats you on the first step because you were playing too far up, say goodbye. He’s already gone. If you sink back with him, he has the shiftiness and the quick release to step back and shoot."</p>
<p>With the ability to lead his teammates on and off the court, and carry his team with his offensive skill set, it’s easy to see why anyone would want Steph on their team.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>The case for Kyrie Irving:</b></h4>
<p>The former number one overall pick in the draft, Kyrie Irving, has also won an NBA championship. Although he lacks the number of awards that Curry has, he has never been given a fair chance to be the main option on an NBA team in his career so far. Irving helped Cleveland do the impossible in last year’s Finals, with the Cavaliers becoming the first team to ever come back from a 3-1 deficit and win. Irving was a focal point on the team that brought the city of Cleveland its first championship in 52 years. Irving averaged 25.2 PPG, 5.8 APG, and 3.2 RPG in the 2016 regular season. Irving is a head coach’s worst nightmare, as he is virtually unguardable. With arguably the best ball control the NBA has ever seen, Kyrie can get around even the best defenders. He is also one of, if not the best finisher in the league right now. Irving can finish at the rim with both hands at a level that is unmatched, and his flashy layups always fire up the crowd.</p>

<br>
<p>His secret is simple, as he states in an interview with Bleacher Report: “I have counters to every move.” Irving is also widely regarded as one of the most clutch players in the NBA. The only knock against Irving? He’s never successfully been able to carry or lead a team on his own. While some may say you can’t fault him for this as he only had a couple of years on his own without LeBron, it is still a valid argument that slots him below Curry. Despite this, Irving is a player that brings every element of offense to the court and any organization is lucky to have him.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>The Consensus</b></h4>
<p>Steph Curry. While both players are incredibly talented, Curry gains the edge because of his resume. Curry has proven he can be a #1 option on a championship team not only in the regular season but in the playoffs as well. Any team would jump at the opportunity to land either of these superstars, but Curry has the edge overall.</p>
<p>With both Curry and Irving set to square off in their third straight Finals tonight, it will be interesting to see who outplays the other and comes out on top.</p>
