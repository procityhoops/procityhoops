<p>The Timberwolves came out of the NBA All-Star break sitting in a third place tie with the Spurs in the West. Their first game coming out of the break was against the Houston Rockets on Friday night. The Wolves were ready and poised to finish off the season strong and make the playoffs for the first time since the 2003/04 season, a decade plus drought. Before Friday's game against the Rockets, Wolves’ guard Jamal Crawford described a practice two days before as ¨the best of the season.” But then, with 3:18 left in the third quarter of Friday's game against Houston, Jimmy Butler went down with a non-contact injury to his right knee. For the Wolves and their fans, it was the last thing that they wanted to see. Butler, an NBA All-Star, had led the Wolves to one of their best records at the All-Star break in franchise history, and now, he was injured and in serious pain.</p>
<p>The waiting game ensued for the Timberwolves. Friday night it was determined that X-rays had came back negative, and the MRI on Saturday would reveal the specific details of the injury. On Saturday, the Timberwolves released a statement that Jimmy Butler had suffered a torn right meniscus in the game against the Rockets. Butler would proceed to get a second opinion on Saturday night while the Wolves took down Butler’s former team: the Chicago Bulls. After remaining quiet, it was released that Jimmy Butler had already undergone successful surgery on his meniscus and his return is TBA, but most people around Butler expect him to be back for the playoffs if the Wolves can hold on to their spot.</p>
<p>Now that is has been determined that Butler will miss an extended part of the rest of the season, how much will his absence mean for the Wolves?</p>
<p>Plain and simple, Jimmy Butler was the heart and soul of the Minnesota Timberwolves. He leads the team in points, steals, and is second on the team in assists. In addition to leading those statistical categories, Butler is the guy the Wolves turn to when the game is getting out of hand. After last night, the Wolves have now played seven games this season without Butler, going 3-4 in those contests.</p>

<p>While 3-4 is not terrible without your star player, the on/off stats with Jimmy Butler may be a cause for concern for Wolves fans. While Jimmy Butler is on the court this season, the Timberwolves have an offensive rating of 116.3. When Butler is off the floor, that offensive rating drops to 109.8. In addition, with Butler on the floor the opponents have an offensive rating of 107.8. When Butler is off the floor, the opponents offensive rating jumps all the way up to 118.4.</p>
<p>With Butler out, the Wolves will have to fill the void by looking for extra production out of a number of players, one guy will not be able to fill the void for an NBA All-Star. On Saturday against the Bulls, it was Jeff Teague who answered the call posting 25 points, 7 rebounds, and 7 assists against the Chicago. In Butler’s previous absence, it was Andrew Wiggins who answered the bell. So, it will take a team effort to fill the place of Jimmy Butler.</p>
<p>Although it will take a team effort to replace Jimmy Butler, the Wolves have the capability of treading water while he is out. Jeff Teague has had somewhat of a down year so far this season after he too injured his knee and was out for a two-week stretch in January. Now, Teague is healthy, and with Butler out, Teague will have the ball in his hands early and often, just like he did on Saturday against the Bulls. In addition, Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns will get more touches and shots, which is a positive for the Wolves. The arrival of Butler has put a dent in Wiggins´ production this season. Last season, Wiggins had a usage percentage of 29%, this season that number has dropped to 23.4% which has caused his points per game to go from 23.6 PPG to 17.7 PPG. With Butler out, Wiggins figures to have his usage percentage hike back up to what it was last season allowing him to be more productive once again.</p>

<p>As for Karl-Anthony Towns, he figures to get more touches with Butler out as well. But, Towns will need to play poised basketball with Butler out. If Towns does not get his touches early, he tends to start forcing shots and becoming disengaged on the defensive end. When Butler is healthy, the Wolves can overcome those problems, but with Butler out, Towns will need to be involved early and often. Finally, Jamal Crawford is also expected to see a hike in playing time and production. Crawford voiced his displeasure for the amount of playing time he received early in the season, but now that the Wolves are shorthanded on the wing, Crawford figures to be back to playing 20+ minutes on a nightly basis.</p>
<p>If Saturday night was any indication of the way the Wolves’ lineup will look without Jimmy Butler, it could be a bit scary for Wolves’ fans. People already complain about how many minutes Tom Thibodeau plays his players. Everyone was wondering who would come in off the bench to replace Butler, but all Thibodeau did was move Nemanja Bjelica to the starting lineup and moving to a three-man bench, yes that is just an eight-man rotation.</p>
<p>After the Spurs took home a win on the Sunday against the Cavs, the Timberwolves are once again tied with them for the third spot in the West. With 19 games remaining, the Wolves have just a 3.5 game lead on the ninth seed Clippers to stay in the playoff picture. The Wolves will likely need to finish the season around 10-9 to hang on in the Western Conference Playoff Picture. If they can do that, then it is possible that Jimmy Butler can return for the Wolves to make a run in the playoffs.</p>
<p>That hunt for the playoffs continues tomorrow night when the Wolves face the Kings in Sacramento before beginning an eight-game stretch against teams who are all above .500 on the season.</p>
