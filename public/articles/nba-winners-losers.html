<h1>NBA First Half Winners and Losers</h1>
<p>The first half of the season has come and gone in the NBA and while the all-star break is not officially half of the season, many factors have come into play to get us where we are today. Golden State and Cleveland have both struggled at times, but both continue to lead their respective conferences. While every team plays 82 games, and there are three rounds of playoffs to be played, all signs point towards a rubber match in this years NBA finals.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Winner: Brett Brown, Head Coach, Philadelphia 76ers:</b></h4>

<p>This season has been filled with circumstances that should have lead towards the Philadephia 76ers being cellar dwellers yet again. Ben Simmons, the number one overall pick in June’s draft, has yet to play this season with a foot injury that he sustained in the offseason. Joel Embiid, while dominant, was just diagnosed with yet another lower body injury and the combination of Jahlil Okafor and Nerlens Noel have spent the entire season in trade rumors. However, Brett Brown has lead Philadelphia to a 21-35 record, their best since 2013. This season has Philadelphia fans and fans all around the league buying into the process and Brett Brown is one main reason why.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Loser: Dave Joerger, Head Coach, Sacramento Kings:</b></h4>

<p>To clarify, Joerger is not a loser due to poor coaching, simply put Joerger has to deal with the turmoil that is Sacramento Kings basketball on a day to day basis. Demarcus Cousins is yet again proving to be one of, if not the best center in basketball, Willie Cauley-Stein has taken steps in his second year as a pro but Sacramento still cannot take the next step in their rebuilding process. Add these factors to the successes of Dave Fizdale in his first season as the head coach in Memphis and this leads to Joerger being a first half loser.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Winner: Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder:</b></h4>
<br>
<p>While some may classify Westbrook as a loser after Kevin Durant’s departure, Westbrook is on pace to be the first player since Oscar Robertson in 1962 to average a triple-double over the course of a season. While Westbrook’s chances of becoming an NBA champion in the near future took a hit, these stats will put him into a class we have never seen before in the modern NBA. Simply put, the best thing that ever happened to Russell Westbrook was Kevin Durant’s departure from OKC.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Loser: Minnesota Timberwolves:</b></h4>

<p>Another long summer is upcoming in the land of 10,000 lakes. Minnesota was picked by many before the season to not only make the playoffs but also push towards the 45 or 50 win mark. This has not happened and Tom Thibodeau is in danger of missing the playoffs for the first time as a head coach. Minnesota has shown signs of taking the next step, however, occurrences such as their third quarter woes, poor bench play and a torn ACL for Zach LaVine have put their season on life support. While we may look back on this season in 5 years as an important stepping stone during their rebuild, Minnesota remains a loser.<p>
<br>
<h4><b>Loser(s): Reggie Jackson, Andre Drummond, Detroit Pistons:</b></h4>

<p>I want to preface this point by saying that Kentavious Caldwell-Pope has been outstanding this season. Caldwell-Pope is having a career year averaging 15 points per game, while shooting 38% from three and becoming a true 3 and D threat for the Pistons. However, with recent news that Detroit has explored trades for both Reggie Jackson and Andre Drummond, this shows the faith they truly have in those players as potential building blocks. Drummond may very well develop into a top 3 center in the league, however, his inability to make free throws, as well as inconsistent play, has really hurt Detroit this season. In regards to Jackson, he has continued to struggle with remaining healthy. While injuries are hard to examine, the numbers when Ish Smith is playing in place of Jackson are not. Detroit is roughly 8 points better this season when Smith is on the court as compared to Jackson. This inefficiency, as well as his max contract, may make it a priority for Detroit to move on from Jackson sooner rather than later.<p>
<br>
<h4><b>Winner: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks:</b></h4>

<p>Has any player in the league improved more, or had a bigger impact on his team than Giannis? Antetokounmpo has made major strides in his third NBA season and has been rewarded with his first all-star birth. Averaging 23.6 points, 5.5 assists and 8.6 rebounds per game, Giannis has taken the Eastern Conference by storm during the first half. While his teammates continue to fall victim to the injury bug, Giannis, at age 22, is changing the game as a point forward and will be a treat to watch for the foreseeable future.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Loser: New York Knicks:</b></h4>

<p>Where to begin? Phil Jackson? Carmelo Anthony? Derrick Rose? This list could go on and on. Off court drama between James Dolan and Charles Oakley has become nearly a bigger disaster than the product on the court. In addition, Phil Jackson’s recent comments about Carmelo do not help during this vital time in their rebuild. Jackson and Dolan have some tough decisions to make in the coming week. Do they trade Carmelo, Joakim Noah and Derrick Rose for pennies on the dollar, or do they try and make a run at the 8th seed? The lone bright spot for the Knicks and their fans continues to be Kristaps Porzingis. His ascension to the NBA’s elite is nearly complete and the numbers he puts up are undeniable. Couple this with the fact that his growth may continue to be stunted by the likes of Carmelo Anthony and Derrick Rose and the Knicks have tough decisions to make.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Winners: James Harden and Mike D’Antoni, Houston Rockets:</b></h4>

<p>Coming into the season, both James Harden and Mike D’Antoni were beginning to become afterthoughts in the NBA. D’Antoni had been long removed from success after his stints with the Lakers and Knicks, and James Harden was still struggling to reach his full potential. This pairing has been a match made in heaven from the beginning and has given both of their careers new life. Harden is averaging 29 points, 8 rebounds and 11 assists per game and the pair has led Houston to a 40-18 record, which is currently good enough for the 3 seed in the west.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Loser: Jimmy Butler, Chicago Bulls:</b></h4>

<p>Poor Jimmy Butler. The Chicago Bulls have self destructed this season after a promising start and have been among the top disappointments in the NBA. While Butler is listed as a loser, his play has been nothing but stellar. Butler is averaging career highs across the board, however, it has not been good enough for Chicago to consistently win. Look for Chicago to possibly move Butler in the next week, which would ascend him to being a winner.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Winner: Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors:</b></h4>

<p>While Durant made headlines last week in his return to Oklahoma City, he continued to torch the Thunder this season. Durant made arguably the most shocking and impactful decision in recent NBA history last offseason when he decided to take his talents to the Bay Area. While Golden State is off their 73-win pace from last season, Durant has fit seamlessly into their offense and Golden State is starting to click at a high level. With the struggles currently happening in Cleveland, the Warriors are NBA title favorites and Durant’s quest for his elusive first ring may come to an end.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Loser: LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers:</b></h4>

<p>​LeBron James is still the best player in the NBA. While players such as Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant may challenge this claim, no player is more valuable to his team than James. Now the question may be asked, why is LeBron James considered a loser? To start, Cleveland has endured midseason struggles which have been hard to ignore. Since Cleveland is attempting to repeat as world champions, they currently look like no match for the Golden State Warriors.  James is also averaging the most minutes in the NBA this season, as well as the highest amount of his career. While some may not view this as an issue, remember LeBron is currently 32 and in his 14th NBA season. In addition to the high minute count, Kevin Love was just diagnosed with a knee injury and will miss the next two months. Even though LeBron continues to play at a high level, he has drawn plenty of criticism in the media for his comments about needing an additional playmaker. This season may prove to wear him down mentally and physically and this could spell disaster in the playoffs.</p>
