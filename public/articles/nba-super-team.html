<h1>The NBA's Real "Super" Team</h1>

<p>What is the true definition of a super team in today’s NBA? Many people may say having two of the top three players in the world. Rolling out four Olympians and three world champions doesn’t hurt. Add in a coach who won five titles as a player and now one as a coach? Yes, The Golden State Warriors are far and away the most talented team in the NBA, and there is not much of a debate when it comes to this fact.  Every definition of a super team could be defined as the Golden State Warriors.  However, Golden State is not the real super team in the NBA, this title belongs to the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>  
<br>
<p>On paper, the Warriors out match the Cavs at arguably every position on the floor. LeBron is the best player in the world, but there is an argument to be made that Durant is 1B to James’ 1A at the small forward position or even vice versa.  The Warriors are a dominant force, shredding the western conference and entire NBA thus far to the tune of an 21-4 record.  Curry, Thompson, and Durant can fill up the stat sheet, but they are missing one key factor, LeBron James.  While LeBron is aging and will be 32 in a few short weeks, no player in the NBA has the same effect on his team that LeBron has.</p>  
<br>
<p>The Cavaliers currently sit at possibly an underwhelming 17-5 at the moment, but who is going to dethrone them in the east?  So far, Toronto and Boston have stuck it out in the east as contenders to the Cavs, but neither has the firepower to take down Cleveland in a seven game series.  Look farther down the list at some teams underachieving. Does Boston really stand a chance in a 7 game series against Cleveland? No. Charlotte? Steve Clifford is a great coach, but the talent level in Charlotte is not nearly high enough to outduel the Cavs in a seven game series.  Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kristaps Porzingis, and Andre Drummond are all supremely talented players, but none of their teams possess the ability to match up with LeBron, Kyrie, and Kevin Love in a seven game series.</p>
<br>
<p>The biggest contender in the eastern conference for the Cleveland Cavaliers this season is themselves. Ever since Ty Lue took over last season, the team has been clicking at a high level.  David Blatt was a good coach, even great at times, but he did not have the relationship with the players that Lue possesses. This relationship with the players makes the Cavs dangerous for yet another season.</p>
<br>
<p>Last season was evidence that the Golden State Warriors broke down in a brutal western conference.  Given the fact that the Warriors need to compete with the likes of the Clippers, Spurs, Houston, Oklahoma City and the rest of the talent in the west may cause another breakdown late in the season.  The Warriors may also be derailed due to the fact that they do not have any resemblance of a post presence anywhere on their roster.  Teams have been attacking the rim at will against Golden State, and they may not be able to score enough to carry themselves through the finals on jump shooting and scoring alone again. The Warriors are ranked 10th in defensive efficiency this season as opposed to third last season. Couple these factors with the fact that the Warriors bench ranks 25th in the league in scoring this season, as opposed to ninth a season ago, and this may spell the end for another successful season in Oakland.</p>
<br>
<p>Let me clarify, Golden State may very well win 70 games again this season. The team is just beginning to mesh and Klay Thompson is starting to find his way in the offense. This team is a nightmare to defend and will average well over 100 points per game.  Steph Curry and Kevin Durant are two of the top three players in the world and this gives them a good chance to win on any given night.  I would not be surprised if the Warriors hoisted the Larry O’Brien trophy this June.  However, the competition in the west, the decreased bench production and the decrease in defensive efficiency will play a major factor for Golden State in the playoffs.</p>
<br>
<p>LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love and J.R Smith are back again this season and look as talented as ever. How they perform in the regular season is not as important as the Warriors due to the lack of talent and competition in the Eastern conference.  LeBron James has led his team, whether it be Miami or Cleveland to the NBA finals since 2011.  The pure dominance that James and the Cavs possess over the remainder of the eastern conference is much greater than even the Warriors have on the west.  Couple this with the fact that Cleveland brought back almost their entire team from last season and this team is as dangerous as ever.  LeBron James bringing a title to his hometown was one of the greatest performances in NBA history.  He led his team over the best regular season team in NBA history and made up a 3-1 lead in the process. Due to this fact, the real super team in the NBA resides in the eastern conference until further notice.</p>
