<p>The Philadelphia 76ers are off to a great 10-7 start early in the season. The team is clicking on both ends of the floor, and their young talent is playing at astronomical levels. Perhaps the biggest early season surprise for the Sixers is Ben Simmons, the first overall selection in the 2016 NBA Draft. Simmons sat out for the entire 2016-17 NBA season with a foot injury. However, Simmons is back to full health, and in the first 17 games of his NBA career, he is playing all-star caliber basketball.</p> 

<p>The Sixers came into the year with a very young team led by Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, and Markelle Fultz. Fultz went down with a shoulder injury early in the season, but Simmons and Embiid have the Sixers playing at a very high level. To say Simmons has been a surprise this season could be an overstatement to some. There are people that have compared Ben Simmons to LeBron James, but I bet very few people would have thought he would be putting up the type of numbers he is putting up so far. Through the first 17 games of the season, Simmons is averaging 18.5 points, 9.1 rebounds, and 7.7 assists per game, and he’s just a rookie. On his 18.5 points per game, Simmons is shooting 51.3% from the field, and he has yet to take a true three-point shot (Simmons has taken seven threes but they have all been from halfcourt or beyond). The fact that Simmons has been able to average 18.5 points per game without a jump shot is mind blowing. Simmons has had the ability to get where he wants, when he wants. Defenses have been sagging off of Simmons, daring him to shoot the ball, but Simmons has been able to attack the rim and has been finishing 60.7% of his shots inside the paint, 3% above the league average. Looking at his shot zones below, you can see that Simmons has only taken nine deep two’s, the rest of his shots have came in or around the painted area.</p>

<p>Along with his freakish scoring abilities, Simmons has embraced the “point forward” position by getting his teammates involved, while also rebounding the ball at a high rate. Simmons’ 7.7 assists per game rank fifth in the NBA and first in the NBA among rookies. Simmons has showcased a tremendous ability to not only crash the defense into the painted area, but then have the capability to throw a pass out to a wide open three-point shooter.</p>

<p>While his offense has been really impressive, Simmons is also putting up tremendous numbers on the defensive end. Simmons is averaging 2.1 steals and 0.8 blocks per game, numbers that are not ordinary numbers for a first-year pro. The 2.1 steals per game has him tied for the second most steals per game with Russell Westbrook in the NBA.</p>

<p>The numbers that Ben Simmons is putting up as a rookie is unheard of, and he is a big reason the Sixers are currently 10-7. If Simmons continues to put up these type of numbers, there is no doubt that he will not only win rookie of the year, but he will also be an all-star.</p>
