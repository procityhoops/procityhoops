<p>It has been a hectic week in the NBA, and it just got even more hectic. News just broke that the Atlanta Hawks have agreed to trade Dwight Howard to the Charlotte Hornets in return for Miles Plumlee, Marco Belinelli, and the 41st pick in the 2017 NBA Draft. In addition to Dwight Howard, the Charlotte Hornets will receive the 31st pick in the NBA Draft on Thursday. Dwight Howard will bring the Hornets toughness down low, something they need badly. Cody Zeller will get to return to the power forward position, and the Atlanta Hawks will enter a rebuild. With the trade of Dwight Howard, it almost certainly means that Paul Millsap will not re-sign with the team over the summer. According to Adrian Wojnarowski, the Atlanta Hawks moved to the Charlotte Hornets for the salary dump after Nets talks. Steve Clifford, the Hornets head coach, has had previous success coaching Howard and knows how to use him. With the NBA Draft still over 45 hours away, make sure to follow our Twitter for the most recent rumors and news.</p>
