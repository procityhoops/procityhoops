<h1>Los Angeles Clippers Free Agency Preview</h1>

<p>After another promising regular season where they finished with a 51-31 record and the fourth seed in the West, Los Angeles lost in game seven of round one to get bounced from the playoffs. After yet another disappointing ending to the season, the Clippers have a lot of free agents and just dealt Chris Paul to the Rockets. With the trade of Chris Paul, are the Clippers considering rebuilding?</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $34 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: None<br>
Unrestricted: Blake Griffin, J.J. Redick, Luc Richard Mbah A Moute, Brandon Bass, Raymond Felton, Marreese Speights, and Alan Anderson</p>
<p>With today’s Chris Paul trade to the Houston Rockets, this may signal the end of an era in Clipper land.  Blake Griffin may still choose to re-sign and run it back with DeAndre Jordan. However, Griffin may find better options on the open market such as Oklahoma City, Boston, or even Toronto if they retain Kyle Lowry. J.J. Redick is the other main free agent the Clippers need to make a decision on. Redick may very well fetch a contract in the 16 to 18 million dollar range this offseason. Do the Clippers match that? If not, look for them to move forward with Austin Rivers as the primary two guard along with Jamal Crawford in the short-term. Mbah A Moute, Bass, Felton, Speights and Anderson may very well return, however, Mbah A Moute may have a multitude of offers after having the best offensive season of his career along with his stifling defense.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Gordon Hayward, Kyle Lowry </p>
<p>Just because Chris Paul is gone, that doesn’t mean Steve Ballmer will give into tanking, right? With the cap space now created by Chris Paul’s departure, either Hayward or Lowry could choose to join DeAndre Jordan in Los Angeles which in turn may give Griffin a reason not to leave. Gordon Hayward would be a perfect fit on the wing as a primary ball handler while still having two of the best frontcourt weapons in the league when healthy. If Hayward decides elsewhere, Kyle Lowry will be able to replace Chris Paul’s 19 points per game as well as bring a tenacity and experience after his experiences in Toronto.  </p>
