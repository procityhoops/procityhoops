<p><b>Q: Could San Antonio be interested in signing Rose?</b></p>
<p>A: I would doubt that the Spurs will express interest in Rose on the buyout market, but Pop always gets the best out of the players they get. At this point, it looks like Rose will be heading to Minnesota to reunite with Tom Thibodeau, Jimmy Butler, and Taj Gibson.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Q: Which teams do you see finishing in the 6-8 seeds for the West?</b></p>
<p>A: Give me the Nuggets in the six spot, the Blazers in the seven spot, and the Clippers in the eight spot. I believe the Nuggets could make some noise in the playoffs, people are forgetting that they have been playing most of the season without Paul Millsap. As for the Clippers, if they stay healthy, I don’t see any reason that they can’t beat out the Pelicans for the final spot in the West.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Q: Who do u see the Cavs signing with the two open roster spots?</b></p>
<p>A: The Cavaliers were definitely the most active team at the trade deadline. They needed a complete culture change, and the Cavs’ front office made that happen. In addition to adding some younger and more athletic players to the team, the Cavs opened up two roster spots through the trades. There is a rumor that one of the spots will go to Kendrick Perkins, but I’m not ready to jump to that conclusion yet. As for the second open spot, there will be a number of names on the buyout market that the Cavs will chase. One name to keep an eye on is Joe Johnson when he’s bought out by Sacramento.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Q: What exactly are the Clippers doing?</b></p>
<p>A: The Clippers surprised everybody a week and a half ago when they unloaded Blake Griffin to the Detroit Pistons. After the deal was made, the sense around the league was that they would also move Lou Williams and DeAndre Jordan. However, Williams signed a three-year contract extension before the deadline, and Jordan was held on to. But, the Clippers are being smart. They still have enough capable players to make a playoff push this season. While they likely won’t get out of the first round in the Western Conference, if they make the playoffs and then get off some money before 2018 NBA Free Agency, they will be in a good spot. In my personal opinion, I have no problems with what the Clippers decided to do at the deadline.</p>

<p>Thanks for all the questions and following along on ProCity Hoops for the NBA Trade Deadline. I look forward to a fun rest of the 2017/18 NBA season.</p>
