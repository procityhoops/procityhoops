<h1>Wild, Wild West</h1>

<p>The Western Conference has been extremely tight this year, to nobody’s surprise. Playoff seeding will come down to the wire from top to bottom. Golden State and Houston are locked in a battle for the top seed, while seeds 3-10 all have a realistic shot at making the postseason. These playoffs have a chance to be special from start to finish. Unlike recent years, there is a real feeling in the air that this year’s NBA Finals matchup may see change.</p>
<p>We will be looking at each conference and how likely it is that somebody upsets Cleveland or Golden State, starting with the West. Plenty of different storylines have emerged from out West, such as, Donovan Mitchell’s surprising campaign, James Harden putting up MVP numbers for the third straight season, and the recent dominance of Anthony Davis.</p>
<p>One thing that remains constant every year is injuries. Injuries this season will definitely impact the playoffs. New Orleans would look like a major threat with a healthy DeMarcus Cousins. Minnesota and San Antonio patiently wait for the return of two-way superstars Jimmy Butler and Kawhi Leonard. While Denver gets back Paul Millsap and other teams seem in good health.</p>
<p>The Clippers and Jazz wild cards and have shots at making the playoffs as well. Either of these teams would make for a tough opponent in the playoffs. The Western Conference race will be engaging and action packed. Ultimately, I have all but one of the current playoff teams making it in the end. I see seeding looking something like this: Houston, Golden State, Portland, San Antonio, Minnesota, Oklahoma City, New Orleans, and Utah.</p>
<p>Multiple exciting matchups are in play with my predicted seeding. 1 vs. 8 pits James Harden, Chris Paul, and the fast paced Rockets against Rudy Gobert and the Utah Jazz. Harden is playing on another level (averaging 31 PPG, 5 RPG, and 9 APG) and that play gives Houston a distinct advantage. Utah has the tools to win at least a game and make the series close. The Pelicans and the Warriors would face off in the first round in what would be a sneaky good series. Anthony Davis has been on a tear since Boogie’s injury. However, Rajon Rondo and Jrue Holiday have stepped their play up as well. It would most likely not be enough to unseat the reigning champs. OKC would meet Portland with an explosive matchup between Russell Westbrook and Damian Lillard being the highlight. A Kawhi Leonard and Jimmy Butler return would lead to a competitive battle between the Timberwolves and Spurs.</p>
<p>Of course all of this is subject to change, which is the beautiful thing about this playoff race. Any combination of teams would make for an exciting first round.</p>
