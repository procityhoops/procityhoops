<h1>Utah Jazz Free Agency Preview</h1>

<p>The Utah Jazz finished the 2016-2017 season with a record of 51-31, good enough for the fifth seed in the Western Conference. After a valiant effort in round two, Utah was bounced from the second round by the Golden State Warriors in four games. After a breakout season from the Quin Snyder led Jazz, uncertainty faces them this offseason. While the jump they made this year was quite impressive, Golden State had no trouble sweeping them in the second round of the playoffs. While this is not something to be ashamed of, Utah may find it prudent to let their free agents go this offseason and start the dreaded rebuild. However, before they take that step, they need to do whatever it takes to convince their free agents to stay.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $32 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: Joe Ingles<br>
Unrestricted: George Hill, Gordon Hayward, Jeff Withey, and Shelvin Mack</p>
<p>No team in the NBA faces the same amount of uncertainty this upcoming offseason than the Jazz. Gordon Hayward, George Hill, and Joe Ingles are all free agents and will be in high demand across the league. While the Jazz could afford to keep all of them by way of their bird rights, are they good enough to beat Golden State? Probably not. This is going to be an important offseason not only Utah, but the entire Western Conference as Utah would go from a top four team to a bottom four team in the league. While re-signing their top three free agents is a must, the Jazz can let Jeff Withey and Shelvin Mack walk to keep as much cap space as possible.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Shabazz Muhammad, Ian Clark</p>
<p>While the importance of this offseason has already been highlighted, Utah’s best free agent targets are their own in Hill and Hayward. If Utah is unable to retain their own free agents, look for them to fall down the standings and into the lottery.</p>
<p>Other than their own free agents, Utah will also need to look elsewhere in free agency to improve. Utah’s free agent targets depend on what Hayward and Hill do. If Hill and Hayward depart, Utah could do much worse than to chase some RFA’s with a good amount of experience to try and replace them. While Shabazz Muhammad has yet to find his role in the association, he has shown an ability to score the basketball. Snyder could opt to try Muhammad out in the same role he used Gordon Hayward to try and somewhat replace his offensive output. Ian Clark would bring a championship pedigree and is a similar player to Hill with the ability to play off the ball and shoot an above average percentage from three.</p>
