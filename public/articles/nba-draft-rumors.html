<h4><b>Sacramento looking to trade up for De’Aaron Fox?</b></h4>
<p>In recent weeks, Kentucky guard De’Aaron Fox has been soaring up draft boards. He has risen so much that some NBA experts suspect he will go as high as pick three to the Sixers. According to Chad Ford, the Kings love De’Aaron Fox, and they have talked about packaging their #5 and #10 picks together in order to move up and get him. Fox averaged 16.7 points, 4.6 assists, and 3.9 rebounds per game in his only season at Kentucky. Although the draft is still over two weeks away, trade talks are starting to take place.</p>

<h4><b>Philadelphia open to trading the third pick?</b></h4>
<p>The Philadelphia 76ers moved up into the third spot during the NBA Draft Lottery. There has been speculation about who the Sixers will take, but Bryan Colangelo is hinting that they might make no selection at pick three. When asked about trading the third pick, Colangelo said: "There are some discussions that have been fairly interesting." It is possible that the Kings have reached out to Colangelo since they are interested in moving up to take Fox. If the Sixers want to acquire more young talent and the Kings are honed in on Fox, it seems like a perfect trade match.</p>
