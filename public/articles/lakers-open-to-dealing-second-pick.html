<p>The Los Angeles Lakers have been everywhere in the rumor mill lately. A report came out last weekend about the Lakers not being honed in on Lonzo Ball because they aren’t sure he will be a star, and they have some concern about LaVar Ball. Now, today, Bleacher Report is reporting that the Lakers weren’t “blown away” by Lonzo’s workout with the team on June 7th. Of course, this could all be a smokescreen to get teams interested in dealing for the second pick. The Lakers don’t want teams who are interested in Josh Jackson, or even De’Aaron Fox to think that they might not have to jump the Lakers to get their player. If the Lakers can slide down a pick or two and still get a player they covet, that might be most desired.</p>
<p>The Lakers haven’t made the playoffs since the 2012-2013 season when they were swept by the Spurs in the opening round. Luke Walton and Magic Johnson have said that they would like to get back to winning as soon as possible and dealing the second pick might help put them on that track. While many NBA experts still expect the Lakers to take Lonzo Ball with the second pick, the Lakers are considering all of their options.</p>
