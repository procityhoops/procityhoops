<h4><b>Karl-Anthony Towns: B</b></h4>
<p>Entering his third NBA season, Karl-Anthony Towns was expected to continue his offensive power, but also improve on his lackluster defense. Towns has not disappointed on the offensive side of the ball, for the most part. Towns is averaging 20.9 points per game, while shooting 52.9% from the field and 35.6% from three-point range. Towns is coming off of a terrific showing Sunday against the Suns posting 32 points on 12-26 shooting. Towns finally got his touches and shots Sunday against Phoenix and it payed off in a big way. The reason Towns is graded just a B is because of his defense. Towns has had a hard time defending early in his NBA career and that has continued this season. Towns cannot seem to decide if he wants to come over and block a shot, or stay with his guy in the post, that leaves KAT not committing to either and leaving the team in a tough position. Towns needs to either commit to getting a block and going up completely on the shooter, or box out his man and prevent an offensive rebound. Obviously the season is only about 25% of the way over and there is still time for KAT to improve his defense and his B letter grade.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Andrew Wiggins: B+</b></h4>
<p>Coming into the season, the big question would be when Andrew Wiggins would sign his max-level contract with Minnesota. It was never really in question, but the process took a bit longer than many people expected. Part of being offered a max contract with the Wolves was a face-to-face meeting with Timberwolves owner, Glen Taylor. Taylor wanted to meet with Wiggins and make sure he was committed to growing on both ends of the floor. And that is exactly what Wiggins has been doing so far this season. Wiggins is averaging 1.4 steals per game, which is a career-high. In addition to his steals, Wiggins looks much more invested on the defensive end of the court. Wiggins has been hustling all season and putting his body on the line chasing loose balls. Maybe, Jimmy Butler is starting to rub off on the young gun from Canada. Along with his improvements on defense, Wiggins has continued to put the ball in the basket. Although it was inevitable that his points per game would go down with Jimmy Butler now in town, Wiggins is still averaging 18.9 points per game on 45.5% shooting from the field. Wiggins has been very efficient on two-point field goals shooting a career-best 50.4% from that range. However, the three-point shot has not been kind to Wiggins so far this season. Wiggins is shooting just 31.7% from three-point distance this season while attempting the most threes per game in his career (4.1). To improve on his B+ grade, Wiggins needs to improve his three-point shot and become an even more complete player. Wiggins is still averaging just 1.8 assists per game, and with the offensive weapons the Wolves have, that number should be much higher.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Jimmy Butler: A-</b></h4>
<p>The biggest move the Timberwolves made in the offseason was acquiring All-Star forward, Jimmy Butler from the Chicago Bulls. Coming off his best season as a pro, the hard working guy from Marquette was expected to provide the Timberwolves with an instant boost. That is exactly what Butler has done. Jimmy Buckets is averaging 17.4 points per game while attempting 14.2 shots per game. After a slow start offensively, Butler has picked up his scoring in the past eight games and is expected to continue to be aggressive on the offensive end of the court. While his offense is starting to flourish, Butler’s defense is a big reason for his A- grade. Butler is leading the Wolves with 1.9 steals per game this season, and he brings a much needed toughness to the Wolves. If Butler continues to defend and flourish offensively, there is no reason that he cannot continue to improve his grade.</p>

<h4><b>Jeff Teague: B+</b></h4>
<p>The Timberwolves moved on from longtime point guard Ricky Rubio in the offseason and brought in a new face to lead the team, Jeff Teague. Tom Thibodeau brought in Teague in hopes of Teague being able to not only play on the ball, but also off the ball. Teague has been inconsistent early in the season for the Wolves, but when Teague is clicking, so are the Wolves. Teague is averaging 14 points and 7.5 assists per game for the Wolves this season. Teague has, for the most part, been aggressive offensively for the Wolves. However, when Teague is not aggressive, the Wolves offense seems to fall apart. Teague has been known to hold on to the ball until the shot clock runs down and then the team has to heave one at the buzzer. If Teague continues to move the ball and attack the rim, he will continue to be a big part of the Timberwolves success.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Taj Gibson: A</b></h4>
<p>One of the biggest question marks of the offseason was the signing of Taj Gibson. The Wolves have Gibson under contract this year for $14 million, which seemed out of the range for most Wolves’ fans liking. However, who is complaining now? Gibson has been one of, if not the biggest reason for the Wolves’ success early in the season. Gibson is known for his toughness on the defensive end of the court, which he has brought, but he is producing on the offensive end of the court in career fashion. Gibson is averaging 10.6 points per game while shooting a career-high 54.1% from the field. In addition, Gibson has been a force on the offensive glass. He is putting up 2.8 offensive rebounds a night, tied for a career-best. Gibson has been one of the biggest surprises for the Wolves so far this season, but his consistency has been welcomed by all of Wolves Nation.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Jamal Crawford: C+</b></h4>
<p>J-Cross was one of the most surprising offseason signings for the Timberwolves. From being traded, to being bought out, he landed with the Wolves in late July. Crawford is the definition of inconsistent and that has been evident so far this season. There will be nights when Crawford puts up 17 points like he did against the Utah Jazz in the home opener, and there will be nights when Crawford goes scoreless like he did Sunday against the Suns. Overall, we all knew that Crawford is not a defensive juggernaut. But, we also knew that he would have nights where we realize just why we signed him. He is averaging 9 points per game off the bench this season, which is not a bad number, but a little more consistency from J-Cross would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Nemanja Bjelica: A+</b></h4>
<p>Nemanja Bjelica has undoubtedly been the biggest surprise and standout for the Timberwolves this season. Bjelica is shooting 51.2% from three-point land, and he is averaging 7.1 points per game while playing just 15.3 minutes a night. Bjelica has been one of the Wolves only threats from downtown, and I think every Timberwolf fan can agree that he needs more minutes. Bjelica is still not the greatest defender that the Wolves have, but he has shown improvement, and he fights for loose balls. Hopefully Bjelica will continue to play at a high level all season, and he will be a vital part of the Wolves future success.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Gorgui Dieng: C</b></h4>
<p>With Taj Gibson being signed by the Wolves this offseason, that meant that Gorgui Dieng would be coming off the bench. Early in the season, it has been hard for Dieng to find his groove he was in last year. Dieng is averaging 6.1 points and 4.5 rebounds per game this season, but he has not looked comfortable with the second unit. It will take time for Dieng to familiarize himself with coming off the bench, but once he gets into his groove, he will be a great weapon with the second unit.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Shabazz Muhammad: D+</b></h4>
<p>Closing in on the end of free agency, Shabazz Muhammad decided to come back to the Wolves on a veteran’s minimum contract. It looked like a steal for the Wolves as they were still in the market for a backup wing at the time. Unfortunately for Bazz and the Wolves, with the new faces on the team, Muhammad has not found his groove offensively yet this season. Muhammad is averaging just 4.4 points per game this season, 5.5 points less than he averaged last season. In addition, Bazz is shooting just 39.3% from the field this season after shooting 48.2% from the field last season. While Bazz has been inefficient offensively, he is still a liability on defense. It has been a rough go of it for Muhammad early in the season, but with 62 games remaining, there is still hope that he will turn it around and be productive the rest of the way through.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Tyus Jones: B</b></h4>
<p>Tyus Jones is coming off of his best game of the season. He drew his first career NBA start on Sunday against the Suns for the injured Jeff Teague. He posted 9 points, 7 assists, 4 rebounds, and 7 steals in the game against Phoenix. On the season, Jones is averaging 3.2 points per game and 2.7 assists per game off the bench. Tyus has been playing much better of late. He is finding his groove on both ends of the floor. He is starting to be much more effective scoring the ball and finding his teammates offensively. And, on the defensive side of the ball, Tyus has been scrappy and fights for a lot of steals, like he did Sunday against the Suns. While Jones is not known as a great individual defender, his work ethic and understanding of the game has taken him a long way on that side of the ball.</p>
