<p>After finishing the season at 43-39, the Atlanta Hawks are looking to make changes. Although that record earned them the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference, their playoff hopes came short with a loss in the first round. The Hawks are facing many important questions this offseason, with the biggest one coming with Paul Millsap (18.1 PPG and 7.8 RPG). Millsap has been a solid first option for a few years now with the Hawks. Even after winning 60 games in the 2014-2015 season under coach of the year Mike Budenholzer, the Hawks best days seem to be behind them with their current roster. The Hawks have reached the playoffs for nine years straight, but if they don’t make the right decisions this summer that streak could come to an end.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $35 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted:  Tim Hardaway Jr.<br>
Unrestricted: Paul Millsap, Ersan Ilyasova, Jose Calderon, Kris Humphries, Mike Muscala, and Thabo Sefolosha</p>
<p>Wow. That’s the first reaction of any fan looking at the numbers for the Hawks this offseason. As they are under the league’s salary cap, they have very limited resources to sign outside free agents this offseason. The Hawks’ first priority has to be re-signing Paul Millsap within the coming weeks. This is an uncertainty however, as he is rumored to many other teams, the top contenders being Minnesota and Denver. If they are somehow unable to sign Millsap, the Hawks should enter a full rebuild. A team led by Dennis Schroeder and Kent Bazemore won’t win you many games in the NBA. Concerning their other upcoming free agents, only two of them should be kept: Ersan Ilyasova and Thabo Sefolosha. Calderon, Muscala, and Humphries won’t be worth their checks this summer, and the Hawks should save whatever money they can. Ilyasova provides valuable bench (and maybe starting) minutes while Sefolosha adds a valuable veteran defender.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Michael Carter-Williams, Ben McLemore</p>
<p>The preface to this section should state that it will be tough for the Hawks to make any outside moves this offseason given their financial situation. The only way they have cap is if all their free agents leave, that’s where the $35 million max space number comes from. However, if they do find the means to sign anyone, these should be the players. MCW will be an unrestricted free agent, and the Bulls are unlikely to re-sign him. A combo guard that can distribute and defend, Carter-Williams would be a good addition. McLemore is going to be on many teams radar this offseason for one reason: his salary. The 24 year old guard that has underperformed his whole career, McLemore won’t receive as much money as other guards in FA.</p>
