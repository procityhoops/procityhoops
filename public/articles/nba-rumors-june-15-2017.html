<h4><b>De’Aaron Fox working out with Philadelphia on Saturday</b></h4>
<p>This morning, Kentucky guard, Malik Monk worked out for the Philadelphia 76ers. After his workout, he confirmed that his college teammate, De’Aaron Fox, is headed to Philadelphia on Saturday for a workout. Fox is among the players that the Sixers are considering with the third selection in the draft. Fox came on strong at the end of the season for Kentucky and led the Wildcats to an Elite Eight appearance. Fox is considered a top-five prospect in the 2017 NBA Draft class.</p>

<h4><b>Sacramento trading up for De’Aaron Fox?</b></h4>
<p>The Sacramento Kings are enamored with De’Aaron Fox. They like him so much that they might be willing to package the fifth and tenth pick in the NBA Draft to move up and select him. The Kings would likely have to move up to pick three to ensure that they can get De’Aaron Fox. If the Kings don’t select Fox with the third pick, they are said to have an interest in Jayson Tatum at pick #5.</p>

<h4><b>Lakers open to dealing pick two?</b></h4>
<p>In recent weeks, there have been many rumors circulating about what the Lakers will do with the second pick. Many NBA experts expect them to stay at #2 and select the hometown kid, Lonzo Ball. However, the Lakers may be taking calls for #2. The LA Times reported this afternoon that the Lakers aren’t ruling out dealing the second pick if the right offer comes around. It might be hard for the Lakers to find the right package for them to deal #2, but if the right offer comes along, it seems like they would be willing to pull the trigger.</p>

<h4><b>Chris Paul to meet with Houston and Denver</b></h4>
<p>Chris Paul is an unrestricted free agent this summer, and there is speculation that he might be leaving the Clippers. According to an NBA executive, Paul has plans to talk with the Houston Rockets and the Denver Nuggets in free agency. The Houston Rockets were defeated in the Western Conference Semifinals by the San Antonio Spurs, and a signing like Paul could get them over the hump. The Denver Nuggets have been trying to acquire a star player ever since Carmelo Anthony has been out of town, and Chris Paul would blend in nicely with Nikola Jokic. The San Antonio Spurs are also likely to receive a meeting with Chris Paul.</p>
