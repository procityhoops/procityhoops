<p>After making the playoffs in the 2015-2016 season, the Charlotte Hornets finished 11th in the East in the 2016-2017 NBA season with a record of 36-56. The Hornets fell off from the previous season, even though their team was practically the same. Kemba Walker had another terrific year as he averaged 23.2 points and 5.5 assists per game. Kemba also shot the ball very well from beyond the arc. He shot 39.9% from three-point range which was a career high for him. Unfortunately for the Hornets, Kemba Walker didn’t get any help. Nicolas Batum did his part averaging 15.1 points and 6.2 rebounds per game, but the rest of the team was nowhere to be found. Even though the Hornets turned the ball over the least amount of times out of all NBA teams during the season, the team only shot 44.2% from the field, fourth worst in the league. Last week, the Hornets acquired Dwight Howard in a trade with the Hawks which will give the team a physical presence down low. The Hornets also added dynamic scorer Malik Monk in the NBA Draft last week in hopes to raise their field goal percentage. Now, the Hornets turn their attention towards free agency to further improve their shooting and awful bench.</p>

<h4><b>Max Cap Space: -$10 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: None<br>
Unrestricted: Brian Roberts, Ramon Sessions, and Christian Wood</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Hornets, they don’t have a lot of cap space to work with in this year’s free agency. However, they also don’t have any big names that will hit the market for their team either. The Hornets would be smart to let Brian Roberts and Christian Wood walk since neither player averaged more than four points for the team last year. As for Ramon Sessions, the Hornets have a decision to make. Sessions has a team option for next year that would pay him just over $6 million. There have been reports that Charlotte will move on from him. With Malik Monk incoming and Jeremy Lamb already on the roster, there won’t be too many minutes to be had for Ramon Sessions.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Omri Casspi, Mike Muscala</p>
<p>The Charlotte Hornets won’t have any money to spend in free agency. They could open some more money up by trading some guys on bigger contracts, but it’s hard to make a team take on money without giving them picks in addition. Casspi and Muscala would be low money options for the Hornets. Both players have experience and are capable bench players. Both players can also step back and hit the three-point shot. These players would give the Hornets more scoring threats off the bench and allow them to space the floor.</p>
