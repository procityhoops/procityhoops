<p>When the Lakers were rewarded the #2 pick on the night of the NBA Draft Lottery, many fans and NBA experts assumed that Lonzo Ball would be the pick. However, Jordan Schultz of the Huffington Post tweeted that if the NBA Draft were today, the Lakers wouldn’t pick Ball because they don’t think he will be a star and they have a concern about LaVar Ball (Lonzo’s father). Schultz’s source went on to say: “It’s not even close right now. Ball won’t be a Laker unless they really start to buy into him as a star.”</p>
<p>Lonzo Ball will work out for the Lakers on June 7th, and it seems like the workout just got a lot more important. Some other names the Lakers might consider at pick two include Josh Jackson, De’Aaron Fox, and Jayson Tatum.</p>
