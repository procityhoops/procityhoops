<p>Tonight, the 7-3 Minnesota Timberwolves are traveling to Golden State to take on the 8-3 Warriors. The Timberwolves are coming off of five straight wins with the most recent victory coming on Sunday night against the Charlotte Hornets. The Warriors, on the other hand, have won four straight and are starting to look like the Warriors from last season.</p>

<p>The Timberwolves are third in the Western Conference, and with a win tonight, the team could propel into first in the conference. After a tough start to the year defensively, the Timberwolves have had the fifth best defense in the last four games. While the matchups were against the Heat, Pelicans, Mavericks, and Hornets, being the fifth best defense in the last four games is a good start for the Wolves.</p>

<p>The Timberwolves will certainly need a big performance from their bench in order to hang with the Warriors tonight. When Golden State goes small, the Timberwolves will likely need to match by going with Butler at the power forward, letting Jamal Crawford get some run with the starters. Since Crawford will likely see the floor a lot with the small lineup, do not be surprised if he surpasses 30 minutes tonight. In addition to Crawford, the Wolves will need Shabazz Muhammad to get rolling off the bench. Bazz has only averaged 3.8 points per game this season, compared to his 9.9 points per game off the bench last season. Luckily for the Wolves, Muhammad has a history of playing well against the Warriors. In his career against Golden State, Muhammad has averaged 11.9 points per game while playing just 20.1 minutes a night.</p>

<p>For the Warriors, they will be without Kevin Durant, who suffered a left thigh contusion in the Warriors’ recent game against Miami. That injury will make it even more important for the Wolves to shut down Steph Curry and Klay Thompson. Curry and Thompson will definitely cause problems for the Timberwolves since Jimmy Butler cannot guard both of them. I expected Butler to match up with Durant tonight, but with KD out, I’d like to see Butler on Curry, who will be orchestrating the Warriors’ offense.</p>

<p>In the end, it will be important for the Wolves to get off to a hot start and keep the momentum on their side throughout the contest. I expect the Wolves to give the Warriors a scare, but the Warriors will eventually prevail with a 110-104 victory at home. While the Warriors will be without Kevin Durant, a team with Curry, Thompson, and Green is all too dangerous on their home court.</p>
