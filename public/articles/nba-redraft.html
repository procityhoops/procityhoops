  <h1>2015 NBA Redraft</h1>
  <p>The 2015 NBA draft has been one of the best in recent memory thanks to the highly talented prospects selected two years ago. They’ve already played over 1 ½ NBA seasons and we have a pretty good idea of their future career trajectory. Today we will be redrafting the rookies from 2015 and seeing which teams made the right picks and which teams furthered their struggles. (This redraft does not include undrafted players from this class).
</p>
<p>#1, Minnesota Timberwolves- Karl-Anthony Towns. Towns has been undoubtedly the player out of this class and will stay in Minnesota.<br>

#2, Los Angeles Lakers- Kristaps Porzingis. Porzingis has given the Knicks a look into the future of big men and Los Angeles will speed up their rebuild with this selection.<br><br>

#3, Philadelphia 76ers- Devin Booker. Booker was one of the biggest steals back in 2015 and his lights-out shooting ability can impact the 76ers right now.<br><br>

#4, New York Knicks- D’Angelo Russell. Russell has been streaky so far in his career but there is no doubt he has potential. Russell will take his talents to the ‘Big Apple” in this draft.<br><br>

#5, Orlando Magic- Myles Turner. Turner has consistently impressed so far in his career and would certainly be an upgrade for the struggling Magic.<br><br>

#6, Sacramento Kings- Justise Winslow. Winslow has shown the skills needed to be an elite defender so far in his career and would be a good addition to a rebuilding Kings team.<br><br>

#7, Denver Nuggets- Emmanuel Mudiay. The point guard from Congo stays in Denver because of his athletic ability and his ability to run an NBA offense in only his second year.<br><br>

#8, Detroit Pistons- Jahlil Okafor. Okafor has displayed his prowess in the post so far in his career and would dominate opponents when paired with paint protector Andre Drummond in Detroit.<br><br>

#9, Charlotte Hornets- Frank Kaminsky. Kaminsky stays in Charlotte in our redraft. Kaminsky has shown the ability to start on an NBA team in a time where quality centers are hard to come by.<br><br>

#10, Miami Heat- Stanley Johnson. Despite his struggles this year, Johnson can still prove to be a viable option for the future in the NBA and replaces Winslow on the Heat.<br><br>

#11, Indiana Pacers- Trey Lyles. Lyles has shown his shooting ability in Utah and has proven that he can be a solid big off of the bench.<br><br>

#12, Utah Jazz- Larry Nance Jr. Despite his older age, Nance is still worthy of a lottery pick due to his athletic ability.<br><br>
​
#13, Phoenix Suns- Kelly Oubre Jr. Kelly Oubre has the potential to be a real scoring threat in the NBA which is why he is slotted at the thirteenth pick.<br><br>

#14, Oklahoma City Thunder- Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. Hollis-Jefferson is a young forward that has been able to contribute to an awful Nets team, and would be a quality player for the Thunder.<br><br>

#15, Washington Wizards (via trade)- Sam Dekker. Dekker is an athletic small-forward that has shown the ability to put the ball in the basket no matter where he is on the court.<br><br>

#16, Boston Celtics- Bobby Portis. Despite his statistical regression so far this year, Portis brings a presence in the paint that Boston desperately needs.<br><br>

#17, Milwaukee Bucks- Terry Rozier. Rozier has been a decent guard off the bench so far in his career which is something the Bucks could use on their second unit.<br><br>

#18, Houston Rockets (via trade)- Mario Hezonja. Hezonja has been a disappointment so far in his career but still has potential, keeping him in the top twenty.<br><br>

#19, New York Knicks (via trade)- Willie Cauley-Stein. Cauley-Stein has all the tools to become a solid center in the NBA but hasn’t put them together yet. He will get a chance to in New York.<br><br>

#20, Toronto Raptors- Josh Richardson. Richardson has proved to be a solid scorer so far in his career and could be a great addition to Toronto’s second unit.<br><br>

#21, Dallas Mavericks- Justin Anderson. Anderson stays in Dallas in this draft because of his ability to score and rebound the ball.<br><br>

#22, Chicago Bulls- Cameron Payne. Payne is a small guard with good playmaking ability making him a good fit on a forward-dominated Chicago team.<br><br>

#23, Brooklyn Nets (via trade)- Norman Powell. Powell has averaged over 7 PPG off of the Toronto bench and could start on a team like the Nets.<br><br>

#24, Minnesota Timberwolves (via trade)- Montrezl Harrell. Harrell has shown strong rebounding ability off the bench in Houston, making him a perfect fit in Minnesota.<br><br>

#25, Memphis Grizzlies- Willy Hernangomez. Hernangomez has produced good numbers so far in his career and could fit in the backup center spot for Memphis.<br><br>

#26, San Antonio Spurs- Tyus Jones. Jones is a young guard who hasn’t been able to prove himself yet, and he can get the opportunity to thrive in San Antonio.<br><br>

#27, Los Angeles Lakers- Rashad Vaughn. The Lakers take the young scorer off the board in Rashad Vaughn at pick number 27.<br><br>

#28, Boston Celtics (via trade)- Richaun Holmes. The Celtics take their second big this draft in Holmes, deepening their bench.<br>
<br>
#29, Brooklyn Nets (via trade)- Jerian Grant. Grant has shown the ability to come off the bench and provide good minutes with the second unit, slotting him at number 29.<br><br>

#30, Golden State Warriors- Jarell Martin. With the last pick in the draft, the Warriors get a solid big off their bench with the power forward from LSU.</p>
