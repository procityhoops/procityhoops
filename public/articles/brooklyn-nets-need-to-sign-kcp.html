<p>Coming into the 2017 NBA offseason, the future of the Brooklyn Nets’ franchise was looking bleak. They were bad enough to earn the best odds at the number one overall pick, but had lost the pick years ago in a trade with the Boston Celtics. Not only that, but they don’t even have their pick next year, either, so the Nets’ ability to build through the draft has been all but destroyed, and as a rebuilding franchise, this greatly hurts their ability to move forward and become a contender again. What’s worse is that other players see this, and the fact that the best player on the Nets’ roster is, at this time, pretty decent, makes the Nets completely forgettable as a contender in free agency for anyone. However, it seems that the Nets have an ability to talk younger players into signing with them. Whether this has to do with the fact that the Nets will gladly overpay them or not, the Nets have come close to getting some decent young players. For example, this year, the Nets signed Otto Porter Jr. to a four-year/$106 million offer sheet, and had Washington not decided to match the offer, Porter would now be a Brooklyn Net. The same happened last year in free agency when Allen Crabbe signed a four-year/$74 million offer sheet, or when Tyler Johnson signed a four-year/$50 million offer sheet, and both offers got matched by the Trail Blazers and Heat, respectively. The Nets have some young players on their roster, but the only ones really worth mentioning are D’Angelo Russell and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. Russell was the 2nd pick in the 2015 NBA Draft, traded to Brooklyn along with Timofey Mozgov’s outrageous contract, with a lot of potential to grow into the Nets point guard of the future. Hollis-Jefferson already has what it takes to become one of the best defensive wings in the league, at just 22 years old, but he needs to get much, much better on offense. However, just two young players with potential aren’t enough, enter Kentavious Caldwell-Pope.</p>
<p>Caldwell-Pope gives the Nets a future to look forward to. Caldwell-Pope is just 24 years old, and can easily become, along with Russell, the Nets backcourt of the future. KCP is a very underrated 3-and-D player, coming off of what might have been his best season yet. Playing in a basketball environment in Detroit, where individual statistics really don’t tell the whole story, Caldwell-Pope was the team’s fourth highest scorer, behind Tobias Harris, Marcus Morris, and Reggie Jackson, being the youngest of the four. His individual stats are sure to go much higher on the Brooklyn Nets, a team where he would basically be the number one scoring option. He will be able to play well with D’Angelo Russell, who is a crafty offensive point guard, not really known for his defense. Pope is good enough on defense to cover the other team’s best guard, and they both still have plenty of room to grow. KCP shot an effective field goal percentage of 55.8% on catch-and-shoot attempts. Russell is best with the ball, creating for his teammates, so this hints that the two would play well together.</p>
<p>Affordable? Sure. The Nets don’t have that much to worry about; the only team really with the cap space and roster flexibility to offer Caldwell-Pope a decent deal would be the Lakers, who would only be giving him a one-year deal. In the meantime, the Nets can meet with Caldwell-Pope, and guarantee him that his best opportunity is to sign with Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Future heads will surely be turned. Last year, the Nets biggest signing in free agency was Jeremy Lin to a three-year/$36 million deal. That didn’t convince any players in this free agency period that Brooklyn would be good enough to play on. Adding Russell is one step, but adding another young guy with potential in KCP is sure to make players consider Brooklyn a lot more next year. Sure, they won’t have their draft pick, but they’ll still have some good young guys to build around. The time is now for the Nets to pick up another player, young and full of potential. They can’t miss out on this one.</p>
