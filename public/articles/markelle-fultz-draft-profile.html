<p>The projected #1 pick and former McDonald’s All-American game participant is said to be a generational talent. Markelle Fultz averaged 23.2 points, 5.9 assists, and 5.7 rebounds per game in his only season at Washington. Washington had a poor season overall going 9-21, but, Markelle Fultz is still projected as the top pick in the 2017 NBA Draft. So, why is everyone so enamored with Markelle Fultz?</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Strengths</b></h4>
<p>One of the biggest upsides for Fultz is that he is a 6’4” guard that weighs 195 pounds. He has terrific size and is very physical for a point guard. His physicality and size will allow him to turn into a terrific defensive threat in the NBA. Teams are always looking for someone that is able to guard the opposing team’s star, and Fultz will develop into just that. Along with his defensive potential, Fultz has the ability to lead his future team in points and assists on the offensive end. He is a very versatile scorer and scores in many different fashions. 71.3% of his attempted shots at Washington last season were inside the three-point line, and he shot an impressive 50.2% on those shots. Markelle Fultz also got to the free throw line 6.7 times per game. While he only connected on 64.9% of those foul shots, getting there is a big plus for the NBA game. Fultz is also very good in the pick-and-roll. 30% of his offense came out of the pick-and-roll and as a guard in the NBA, Fultz will be running a ton of pick-and-roll. Off of the pick-and-roll, Fultz likes to attack the rim or go to his potent pull-up. At times it seems like Fultz can get to his pull-up spot at will and when he can’t, he attacks the rim or finds a teammate. Speaking of finding teammates, Fultz is a very good and under control passer. With an assist percentage of 35.7 (Higher than Lonzo Ball), he loves creating offense for his teammates, and he will be very dangerous on a well spaced NBA team.</p>
<p>Fultz’s defense was touched on earlier, but not in great detail. Fultz has the potential to become a lockdown defender in the NBA. He showed great defensive potential at Washington and with the right mindset, he will be able to defend the best guards in the NBA. A final strength of Fultz’s is his maturity. He acts much older than his age on the basketball court. The game never seems too big for Fultz, and he always has himself under control. Obviously, Fultz is a generational talent and (presumably) the Boston Celtics are getting a terrific player.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Weaknesses</b></h4>
<p>Most of Markelle Fultz’s weaknesses have to do with his mindset. At Washington, Fultz had a tendency to become “uninvolved” in the action and space out. He likely became bored with his competition, but his mindset did affect him throughout the season. Fultz also needs to work on his consistency. The consistency factor will be fixed if he always has the right mindset, but Fultz did have some poor shooting performances in his freshman season at Washington. For example, Fultz shot 0-4 and 1-5 from three against top-ranked teams in Arizona and Oregon. Fultz can get flustered by top-tier defenders that don’t let him get to his spots. Fultz will need to learn how to play off of what the defense is giving him so he can be more consistent.</p>
<p>A final area that Fultz will need to work on is his ball handling. Fultz has a tendency to carry a loose dribble that is especially noticeable on his spin moves. There was a number of occasions last season when Fultz would lose his dribble on a spin move because it was too far away from his body. If Fultz can get the right mindset into place and work on some little flaws, there is no question that he will be able to lead an NBA team.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>NBA Comparison</b></h4>
<p>James Harden. Harden is such an obvious comparison for Markelle Fultz. Both players have extreme offensive versatility and can play on and off the ball. Fultz, much like Harden, gets to the free-throw line at a high rate and loves the mid-range jump shot. Harden and Fultz both have terrific size for guards, which allows them to rebound at a high rate and finish effectively at the rim. However, Fultz has the potential to be better than Harden on the defensive end if he puts his mind to it. Harden isn’t considered the greatest defensive talent, but Fultz has all the potential in the world to be a fantastic two-way player in the NBA.</p>
