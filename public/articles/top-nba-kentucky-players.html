<p>Each week, for the next month or so, there will be a focus on a certain college basketball powerhouse. A powerhouse that not only has success at the college ranks, but also at the professional level. This week’s focus will be the <b>University of Kentucky Wildcats</b>.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Kentucky Wildcats</b></h4>
<p>• 8 National Championships (1948, 1949, 1951, 1958, 1978, 1996, 1998, 2012)<br>
• 17 Final Fours<br> 
• 31 SEC Tournament Championships/50 SEC Regular Season Championships<br> 
• Players drafted since ABA-NBA Merger: 80; Players drafted during John Calipari era (2009-present): 32
</p>
<p>Calipari has had extreme success in Lexington and has the Cats competing for chips nearly every season. Let’s talk about the TOP five Kentucky players in the NBA right now:</p>
<br> 
<h4><b>1. Anthony Davis (New Orleans Pelicans)</b></h4>
<p>• #1 pick in 2012 NBA Draft by New Orleans Hornets<br>
• One and done at Kentucky<br>
• National Champion at UK in 2012<br> 
• Final Four Most Outstanding Player<br>
• Consensus National Player of the Year <br>
• Consensus first-team All-American<br>
• NABC Defensive Player of the Year <br>
• SEC Player of the Year <br>
• SEC Defensive Player of the Year<br> 
• 4x NBA All-Star (2014, 2015, 2016, 2017)<br>
• Signed a five-year, $145 million contract extension with New Orleans in 2015 (richest in NBA history at the time) 
</p>
<p>A lot can be said about this kid, who experienced an incredible growth spurt in high school, which led to guard-like skills for a guy who is 6 feet 11 inches tall. In 40 games at Kentucky, Davis averaged 14 points per game, 10 rebounds per game, and 4.7 blocks per game. He was the National Player of the Year and wasn’t even in the top three in shots attempted on the team. That says a lot about the value of Davis. Anytime he is on the floor, which is a lot, he must be accounted for. His numbers have increased every season and as of last year, his career averages are 22.4 PPG, 11.8 RPG, and 2.2 BPG. His best season in the NBA was last year when he averaged 28 PPG, 11.8 RPG, and 2.2 BPG. With the addition of DeMarcus Cousins on the Pelicans and a flurry of young guards like Duke Rookie Frank Jackson, the Pelicans are looking to get back to the playoffs, but Davis is without a doubt the best Kentucky Wildcat in the NBA.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>2. DeMarcus Cousins (New Orleans Pelicans)</b></h4>
<p>• #5 Pick in 2010 NBA Draft by Sacramento Kings<br> 
• One and done at Kentucky<br>
• First-team All-SEC <br>
• SEC Rookie of the Year<br> 
• SEC All-Rookie Team<br> 
• 3x NBA All-Star (2015, 2016, 2017)<br> 
• Signed four-year, $65 million contract in 2014 with Sacramento
</p>
<p>Davis’ teammate, DeMarcus Cousins provides a physical force with a savvy offensive game down low. He too has guard skills and is known for taking the ball coast-to-coast and finishing with thunderous dunks. With he and Davis as a 1-2 punch in New Orleans, maybe this is the year Cousins finally makes the playoffs. Cousins averaged 15.1 PPG, 9.8 RPG, and 1.8 BPG in his one year at Kentucky and those numbers have increased since he has entered the league. He has career averages of 21.2 PPG, 10.8 RPG, 3.0 APG, and 1.2 BPG with his best season being the 2016-2017 year averaging 27.8 PPG, 10.6 RPG, and 4.8 APG. Cousins, like Davis, is extremely skilled at the big man position and the Pelicans should dominate all NBA frontcourts this year. </p>
<br>
<h4><b>3. John Wall (Washington Wizards)</b></h4>
<p>• #1 Pick in 2010 NBA Draft by Washington Wizards<br>
• One and done at Kentucky <br>
• SEC Player of the Year <br>
• Consensus first-team All-American<br>
• 4x NBA All-Star (2014, 2015, 2016, 2017) <br>
• Signed four-year, $170 million extension in 2017 with Washington
</p>
<p>It hurts to put Wall down at number three, but there is no shame being the third guy on a list behind Cousins and Davis, so it’s not all that bad. Wall has electrifying speed and at first he didn’t know how to use it in the NBA, but that has quickly changed. He is now one of the best point guards in the entire league and has put his Wizards team in position to be a threat to LeBron and the Cavs in the East. With Bradley Beal emerging has a top scorer, along with the rise of Kelly Oubre and Otto Porter Jr., the Wiz kids might have a shot. Wall will certainly be the centerpiece of their success, so as long as he is on the court, the Wizards have a chance.</p>

<h4><b>4. Karl-Anthony Towns (Minnesota Timberwolves)</b></h4>
<p>• #1 Pick in the 2010 NBA Draft by Minnesota Timberwolves<br>
• One and done at Kentucky <br>
• SEC Freshman of the Year <br>
• First-team All-SEC<br>
• Consensus second-team All-American<br>
• NBA Rookie of the Year <br>
• Still on rookie contract
</p>
<p>How common is it to find arguably the three best big men in the NBA from the same school? Add Towns to the list of Kentucky big men who are taking the league by storm. In a few short years, KAT will be at the top of this list. He is a force for his size, just like Cousins and Davis, and loo,ks to bring the Timberwolves out of their playoff drought. Towns averaged 10.3 PPG, 6.7 RPG and 2.3 BPG at Kentucky. Those numbers may seem low, but he played on a team with a platoon system and minutes were sacrificed. Playing less minutes didn’t prove to be much of a problem as Towns was still selected number one in the 2015 NBA Draft. His best NBA season was his last one where he averaged 25.1 PPG, 12.3 RPG, 2.7 APG, and 1.3 BPG. Big KAT has a strong inside post game and can also stretch the floor with his shooting. He is already a force in the league and is still a few years away from his prime. Kevin Durant echoed that Towns would be a Hall of Famer in his rookie season. With Towns, Wiggins, and Jimmy Butler, the Wolves now have a scary team in Minneapolis. Expect the Wolves to be back in the playoffs with their fiery coach, Tom Thibodeau, and a flurry of youngsters. They are certainly a team on the rise. </p>
<br>
<h4><b>5. Devin Booker (Phoenix Suns)</b></h4>
<p>• #13 pick in 2015 NBA Draft by Phoenix Suns <br>
• One and done at Kentucky <br>
• SEC All-Freshman Team <br>
• Second-team All-SEC<br>
• Still on rookie contract but expect Booker to be an NBA All-Star and get a max contract very soon 
</p>
<p>Scoring 70 points in an NBA game is very impressive. What is even more remarkable is Devin Booker scored 70 points in a NBA game at the age of 20. He is compared to Klay Thompson and that is a very fair comparison. Aside from looking alike, their games are very similar. Both of them can catch and shoot with the best of them, and can also put the ball down on the floor and score in the paint. Booker is only going to get more comfortable as he grows so the Suns definitely have a bright future with the team centered around Booker. He averaged 10 PPG, shot 41 percent from 3-point range, and 82 percent from the FT line at Kentucky. He came off the bench at Kentucky, which shows you how stacked that team was. It’s hard to imagine a team with Towns and Booker, with Booker not starting. The Suns have added Josh Jackson but are still a few years away from being a force. Booker will certainly have a lot to do with that.</p>
<p>That concludes the first edition of University Pros on Pro City Hoops. Next week will feature another college basketball powerhouse, Duke University. </p>
