<p>The Boston Celtics own the #1 pick in the 2017 NBA Draft. All NBA experts are predicting that they will select Markelle Fultz from Washington. However, Danny Ainge isn’t ready to make the final decision. In a telephone interview from Las Vegas, Ainge stated: “The only thing we know for certain is we have the #1 pick.” He later continued: “What we don't know for certain is who that person is yet and what sort of value the pick can get us if we choose to go another direction other than just drafting that pick."</p>
<p>Danny Ainge is leaving the door open, and according to Adam Himmelsbach of the Boston Globe, teams have already been calling to check if the top pick is available. One team to keep an eye on is the Philadelphia 76ers. The Sixers need a guard and have the assets to move up two spots into the top slot in the draft. It’s possible that names like Dario Saric or Jahlil Okafor could come up in discussions along with the third pick. Although talks aren’t currently happening, it is a story to keep an eye on.</p>
