<h1>Boston Celtics Free Agency Preview</h1>

<p>The Boston Celtics had a terrific 2016-2017 season. They finished as the top seed in the Eastern Conference with a record of 53-29. However, the Celtics were knocked off in the Eastern Conference Finals by LeBron and the Cavs. But, the Celtics didn’t hang their heads. The Celtics had the #1 pick in the 2017 NBA Draft before trading it to Philadelphia for a future pick and the third pick in the 2017 NBA Draft. The Celtics took Jayson Tatum with the third pick last week, who some are comparing to the next Paul Pierce. While the Celtics had a successful draft, they need to make a splash in free agency to overcome LeBron in the East.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $33 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted:  Kelly Olynyk<br>
Unrestricted: Gerald Green, Jonas Jerebko, Amir Johnson, and James Young</p>
<p>Fortunately for the Celtics, they don’t have any core pieces of the team hitting the free agent market this offseason. Kelly Olynyk had some big games in the postseason for the Celtics last year, but the Celtics can match any contract Olynyk signs if they want to. Amir Johnson is someone the Celtics should have an interest in bringing back. Johnson started some games for the Celtics last season, but moving him to the bench would be beneficial for both sides. As for Green, Jerebko, and Young, they might not be able to come back to Boston just because the Celtics need roster space and can find veterans to produce more victories. </p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Gordon Hayward, Blake Griffin</p>
<p>The Celtics have the cap space to make a splash in free agency. That is exactly what they need to do. The Celtics can’t keep prolonging this incredible potential they have. At some point, they need to use their assets to make a trade, and they need to go all in on a free agent. This should be the summer the Celtics do that. With the potential of LeBron leaving for Los Angeles next summer, it would be smart for the Celtics to start their quest for the NBA Finals this season. Gordon Hayward would provide the Celtics with a great scoring small forward who is coming off a terrific season in Utah. Blake Griffin would provide the Celtics with a much needed big man. The Celtics struggle on the glass, but Griffin would help that category. When he’s not injured, Blake Griffin is one of the top power forwards in the NBA. It would be smart for the Celtics to put all their chips forward this offseason to make a run at the Cavs next year.</p>
