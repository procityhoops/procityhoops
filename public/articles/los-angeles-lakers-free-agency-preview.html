<p>The Los Angeles Lakers finished the 2016-2017 NBA season 26-56, slotting them 14th in the competitive Western Conference. The Lakers young players showed promise, but it didn’t translate into wins. Newly hired coach Luke Walton brought the young guys along slowly and didn’t give them too much to handle at once. Julius Randle seemed like he could go for 30 points and 10 rebounds a night when he wanted to, but it didn’t seem like his motor ran every night. D’Angelo Russell turned in 15.6 points and 4.8 assists per night, but now he is off to Brooklyn. Larry Nance Jr. took another step in the right direction in his sophomore season averaging 7.1 points and 5.9 rebounds per game in just 22.9 minutes per game. Rookie Brandon Ingram struggled to find his groove and averaged just 9.4 points per game in almost 29 minutes a night. But, on Thursday night, the Lakers found their point guard for the future. The Lakers drafted Lonzo Ball with the second overall pick in the 2017 NBA Draft and later added names like Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart, and Thomas Bryant to round out a successful draft. Now, the Lakers turn their heads to free agency to further improve their roster. </p>
<br>
<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $24 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: None<br>
Unrestricted: Tyler Ennis, Thomas Robinson, Metta World Peace, and Nick Young</p>
<p>The Lakers, like many other teams, don’t have much to worry about in terms of retaining their own players. The biggest free agent from the Lakers 2016-2017 roster is Nick Young. Young averaged 13.2 points per game while shooting 40.4% from three-point range in the 2016-2017 season. However, in order to retain Nick Young, the Lakers would likely need to fork over at least $15 million a year, and they need that money for next summer when they make a run at LeBron James and Paul George. As for the other Laker free agents, Tyler Ennis would be the only other name to keep an eye on. Ennis averaged 7.7 points per game for the Lakers last season while playing just 17.8 minutes a night. If the Lakers can re-sign Ennis for cheap, he would be a solid option off the bench.

<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Willie Reed, Patty Mills</p>
<p> To preface, the Lakers have the cap space to make a splash in this year’s free agency; however, Magic Johnson has said that they would like to hang on to their space in order to make a run at top name free agents next summer. A guy like Willie Reed would be able to come in and learn under Brook Lopez. Reed is 27 years old but will be going into just his third season in the NBA. If Reed gets the minutes, he can be a top rebounder in the NBA. Per 36 minutes last season for the Heat, Reed averaged 13.1 points and 11.6 rebounds per game. A guy like Patty Mills, on the other hand, would be able to mentor Lonzo Ball. Mills could be the backup point guard for the Lakers and show Lonzo the way in the NBA. Having played for Coach Pop in San Antonio for six seasons, Patty Mills could drop a lot of NBA knowledge on Lonzo Ball.</p>
