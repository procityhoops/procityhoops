<p>The San Antonio Spurs had another terrific season in the NBA. They made the postseason for the 20th straight season. They finished the season with a 61-21 record ranking them as the second best team in the NBA behind the Golden State Warriors. It was Golden State who defeated the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals and had Kawhi Leonard not gotten hurt in game one of the series the Spurs might have put up a fight against Golden State. Leonard led the Spurs the entire season averaging 25.5 points and 5.8 rebounds per game. The Spurs, like always, also had great depth. They had Pau Gasol and Manu Ginobili coming off the bench for a good portion of the season. When a team has that kind of veterans coming off the bench, good things are bound to happen. The Spurs were expected to be a player in the Chris Paul sweepstakes this summer, but he is now a member of the Houston Rockets. The Spurs will now have to try and find more quality players to fit in and help them chase a title next season.</p>

<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $21 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted:  Jonathan Simmons<br>
Unrestricted: Joel Anthony, Dewayne Dedmon, Pau Gasol, Manu Ginobili, David Lee, and Patty Mills</p>
<p>The Spurs have a unique situation with their own players in free agency this summer. They have an up-and-coming player in Jonathan Simmons hitting restricted free agency after just one season in the NBA. They also have a lot of their veteran depth hitting unrestricted free agency. The Spurs should try to re-sign Simmons if possible, but if he gets too expensive, they can afford to let him go. Simmons is a terrific talent, but it isn’t worth giving all your cap room to a guy who has only played one season in the NBA. Pau Gasol has said that he will be back for the Spurs, so there is no worry for the team on that front. David Lee will also likely be back to chase an NBA Championship. If Manu Ginobili decides to play another season in the NBA, there is no question that he will be back with the team. The one question the Spurs do have is what will happen to Patty Mills. Mills is a terrific backup point guard in the NBA, but the Spurs might not be willing to offer as much money as some other teams will for Mills. The Spurs should also consider bringing back Dewayne Dedmon if they can get him back on a cheaper deal. He is a good backup big man and can give the Spurs quality minutes off the bench.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Kyle Lowry, Rajon Rondo</p>
<p>The San Antonio Spurs could very likely lose Patty Mills in free agency. However, this isn’t the worst case scenario for San Antonio. If Mills leaves, San Antonio can sign a starting point guard and move Tony Parker to the bench. Parker is getting old and coming off the bench to play fewer minutes is the ideal situation for him at this point in his career. Both Kyle Lowry and Rajon Rondo would provide the Spurs with win-now point guard options. Lowry had a career year for Toronto last season, but it seems like he is ready to win. Rajon Rondo had some problems in the Bulls organization last year, but there isn’t a better place to get your career back on track than in San Antonio. Of course, getting Rondo would require the Bulls to buy him out, but, with the Bulls headed in the direction of a rebuild, that’s a likely outcome.</p>
