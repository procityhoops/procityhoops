  <h1>Trade Deadline Breakdown</h1>
  <p>The NBA trade deadline is just a handful of days away and many expect there to be some fireworks. With the deadline on Thursday, the NBA has already seen a handful of trades made in advance of the trade deadline. The two most recent being Serge Ibaka to Toronto and Jusuf Nurkic and Mason Plumlee switching teams. Throw in the Kyle Korver trade to the Cavaliers earlier in the year, and the NBA has already experienced some league changing trades thus far. However, many more names have floated around and many players can be had at the right price. So, lets look into some possible players that could be traded by Thursday.

    <h3>Lou Williams, Los Angeles Lakers:</h3>
    <p>The Los Angeles Lakers started the season hot and it looked like they might be a big surprise of the NBA season. However, they quickly fell down in the standings and currently sit in 14th in the West, only above the Phoenix Suns. Although their season hasn't been filled with many high points, one standout on the season has been sixth man, Lou Williams. Williams is in his twelfth season in the NBA and is putting up some big numbers for the Lakers this season off the bench. While only playing 24.2 minutes a night, Williams is averaging 18.6 points per game and is shooting 38.6% from downtown. Lou Williams would be a great veteran presence off the bench for a team looking to make a playoff push. One team to keep an eye on is the Washington Wizards, as they are said to be buyers and Lou Williams could really help their team off the bench and give John Wall and Bradley Beal more of a break.</p>

    <h3>Jahlil Okafor, Philadelphia 76ers:</h3>
    <p>My oh my what a week it has been for Jahlil Okafor. Last Saturday, Jahlil Okafor was held out of a game against the Miami Heat and Brett Brown said after the game it was "trade related". Then, Okafor didn't travel with the Sixers to Charlotte and everyone obviously thought his time in Philly was coming to an end. Then, nothing happened. Portland, who was in the mix for Okafor, went out and completed a trade with Denver for Jusuf Nurkic taking them out of the conversation for Okafor. Now, here we sit and still nothing has happened. However, it only takes one call to make a trade happen and off of everything that has gone down in the past week, I fully expect Jahlil Okafor to be in a different uniform come next Friday.</p>

    <h3>Brook Lopez, Brooklyn Nets:</h3>
    <p>The Brooklyn Nets are not in a good place whatsoever. Not only is Brooklyn sitting in the cellar of the NBA, but they also owe the Boston Celtics their draft pick this year, from the horrendous trade for Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett. So, Brooklyn is terrible and they don't have their draft pick to capitalize off of it. Fortunately for Brooklyn they do have one piece that can get them some value back in a trade: Brook Lopez. By the time the Nets are good, Lopez will be old and not contributing anymore, so it would be smart for Brooklyn to get some value for him now and speed up the rebuild process. Brook Lopez is averaging 20.8 points per game and is a veteran presence down low. If a team like the New Orleans Pelicans can pull off a deal for Lopez, him and Anthony Davis would be virtually impossible to stop down low.</p>

    <h3>Carmelo Anthony, New York Knicks:</h3>
    <p>Carmelo Anthony has been at the center of trade talks for the past couple of weeks now, with Phil Jackson looking to move on from the ten time all-star. This season Carmelo has posted 23.4 points per game, up from his 21.8 per from last season. But, the Knicks seem like they want to enter rebuild mode around Kristaps Porzingis and in order to do that they need to move on from Carmelo Anthony. Remember, Carmelo Anthony can control anything the Knicks do with him since he has a no trade clause. So in theory, if Carmelo Anthony wants to stay in New York, he can stay in New York. But, if Carmelo Anthony is open to waiving his no trade clause there is a very good chance he has played his last game as a New York Knick.</p>
