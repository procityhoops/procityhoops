<h1>What should the Celtics do with the first pick?</h1>
<p>Last night the Celtics were embarrassed by the Cavaliers at home. They lost to the Cavs by 44 points and now trail in the Eastern Conference Finals 2-0. But the worst part about losing their first two games of the series? The games were played at the TD Garden, the Celtics’ home court. However, not all the events that transpired this week were bleak for Celtics fans. Thanks to Billy King, the Brooklyn Nets’ former general manager, the Celtics were awarded the first overall pick in the 2017 NBA Draft last Tuesday night.</p>
<p>At the trade deadline this season, many people argued that the Celtics should trade their draft ammunition in order to make a Finals push this year. However, with LeBron James still in the East and more dominant than ever, is that the smart route?</p>
<br>
<h4><b>The Options</b></h4>
<p>The first option the Celtics have is to trade their pick this year. With the #1 pick in the most loaded draft in recent memory, teams would be heavily interested in moving up to select a future all-star. At this season’s trade deadline, the Celtics were linked to Jimmy Butler and Paul George. Those two names could still be in play if they decide to deal the top pick. The Chicago Bulls were recently eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Celtics, and there are rumors about whether or not Chicago will rebuild. If the Bulls decide to rebuild, the Celtics could likely swing a trade for Butler by including the #1 pick and a few other pieces.</p>
<p>The Pacers were also eliminated in the first round of the playoffs this season. However, Paul George has publicly expressed interest in Los Angeles and joining the Lakers as a free agent in 2018, which might prevent this trade from happening. Nevertheless, if the Celtics get a verbal commitment from George to resign next summer, this trade might be back on the table. Other than George and Butler, there are not many big names that will be on the block this summer. </p>
<br>
<p>The second option the Celtics have is to stay at #1 and make a draft selection. NBA experts have been predicting that the Celtics would select Washington Huskies guard Markelle Fultz at #1. Fultz averaged 23.2 points, 5.9 assists, and 5.7 rebounds per game in his freshman year at Washington. He also shot an above-average 41.3% from three-point range. Fultz is a 6’ 4” guard that put up impressive numbers on a Washington team that went 9-21 and missed out on the NCAA tournament. Fultz would offer the Celtics some immediate help and could slide in at shooting guard next to Isaiah Thomas. Fultz is only 19 years old and is almost guaranteed to be a force in the league for years to come. The one issue in selecting Markelle Fultz is that the Celtics might have to ship Avery Bradley out of town. Bradley will want a massive contract next summer as he is a free agent. If the Celtics plan to go hard after Gordon Hayward this offseason, they will not have the cap space for Bradley next summer. Avery Bradley is also a proven starter in the league. If the Celtics take Fultz at #1 and use him next to Isaiah Thomas, Bradley would be coming off the bench. The last thing Bradley wants to do in the prime of his career is to become a sixth-man. Some other intriguing players at #1 include Lonzo Ball, Josh Jackson, and Jayson Tatum. However, Fultz would provide the Celtics a quality guard that would contribute immediately.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Consensus</b></h4>
<p>The Boston Celtics should keep the #1 overall pick in the 2017 NBA Draft and select Markelle Fultz. LeBron James will not be out of the league for at least a couple more seasons and until then, the Celtics are not going to represent the Eastern Conference in the NBA Finals. The selection of Fultz will allow the young Celtics to continue to grow and develop. If everything goes according to plan, Fultz and the Celtics will get back to the Eastern Conference Finals next year and once again obtain the #1 pick in the 2018 NBA Draft.</p>
