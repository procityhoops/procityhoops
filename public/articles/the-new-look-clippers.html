<h1>The New-Look Clippers</h1>

<p>If the Los Angeles Clippers’ roster stays as it currently is, they will only have seven players from last year’s team return. Of those seven players, just two of them were regular starters for the team last season: Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan. Through one way or another, the Clippers lost Chris Paul, J.J. Redick, Jamal Crawford, and Luc Richard Mbah a Moute this summer. These players combined for 51.5 of the team’s points per game in the 2016-17 season, roughly 47% of the team’s points each night. Losing these key guys could end up coming back to bite the Clippers, but the Clippers have never made the Western Conference Finals, so maybe, just maybe, a change was a good idea.</p>
<p>While many of the old Clipper core players left or were traded, in the span of a couple of weeks, the team gained several new ones. Some of the newest key additions include Danilo Gallinari, Patrick Beverley, Lou Williams, Sam Dekker, Milos Teodosic, Willie Reed, and Montrezl Harrell. Each of these additions will play a key role in the Clippers’ current and future plans.</p>

<p>The key idea when the Clippers made their changes seemed to be gaining depth. A number of their additions will give them just that. Williams, Dekker, Teodosic, Reed, and Harrell will all be main contributors off the bench. The Clippers have had trouble staying healthy in years past with guys like Blake Griffin and Chris Paul going down with significant injuries. Although Paul is now in Houston, if Griffin or any other starter goes down with an injury, Doc Rivers should be very comfortable bringing in the next man up.</p>
<p>Bringing in Lou Williams was the first step for the Clippers to gain depth. Williams averaged 17.5 points per game last season even though he played just 24.6 minutes a night and started only one game. Williams will give the Clippers a huge boost off the bench when the starters need a break, much like Jamal Crawford had done for the team throughout the last five seasons.</p>
<p>After the Clippers acquired their sixth man, they did not stop there. They went on to get more solid role players like Sam Dekker, Milos Teodosic, Willie Reed, and Montrezl Harrell. Each of those players will be able to provide stability off the bench for Los Angeles, something the Clippers are not used to. Dekker came on strong for Houston last season averaging 6.5 points and 3.7 rebounds per game in just 18.4 minutes a night off the bench. Teodosic was signed as a pass-first point guard to be the primary backup to Patrick Beverley. Teodosic seems to have eyes in the back of his head, having a similar play style as Ricky Rubio of the Utah Jazz. It will be a refreshing sight for the Clippers to have an actual backup point guard after they have rolled with players who do not play point guard as their main position in the last few seasons. Next up is Willie Reed and Montrezl Harrell. Both bigs will play a pivotal role for the Clippers because of who is in front of them: Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan. If either of those two players go down, it will be crucial for Reed and Harrell to step up. Harrell got a big chance in the middle of the season for the Rockets last year when Capela went down, and he showed just how valuable he could be. In the months of December and January last season, Harrell averaged 10.7 points and 4.1 rebounds per game while only seeing the court for 21.7 minutes a night. With Harrell being just 23 years old, there is no reason why he cannot average those numbers, or better, if he is given the appropriate amount of playing time. Willie Reed also had a solid season for Miami last year. While playing 14.5 minutes per game, he managed to average 5.3 points and 4.7 rebounds a night, numbers that come out to 13.1 points and 11.6 rebounds per 36 minutes. These two big men, along with their other bench additions will put the Clippers’ bench production near the top of the league.</p>
<p>Even though the Clippers have an improved bench and more depth going into next season, starters like Chris Paul, J.J. Redick, and Luc Richard Mbah a Moute will leave big holes to fill in Los Angeles. This is where Patrick Beverley, Austin Rivers, and Danilo Gallinari come into play. Despite playing in only 61 games last season, Chris Paul is still one of the top point guards in the NBA. He averaged 18.1 points and 9.2 assists per game last season, numbers that ranked very high for point guards in the NBA. However, acquiring defensive-minded Patrick Beverley from the Rockets to replace Paul is not the worst thing that could have happened. The Clippers ranked in the middle of the NBA in terms of defense last year, and Patrick Beverley will bolster them into one of the top-ten units on the defensive side of the ball next season. Next up is Austin Rivers. While J.J. Redick is very efficient shooting the basketball, he is not able to help a team in many other ways. Rivers will be able to step into the starting lineup for good and provide the Clippers with many different weapons. Rivers can not only score the ball, he can also find his teammates. He also shoots 37.1% from three-point range, it is not 42.9% which Redick shot last season, but it is something that you can deal with if you are Los Angeles. And perhaps the biggest addition to the Clippers this offseason was Danilo Gallinari. Gallinari, in my opinion, has been underrated for quite some time. When he is healthy, he is one of the top small forwards in the NBA. Gallinari averaged 18.2 points and grabbed 5.2 rebounds per game last season in Denver. He also finished tied for fifth with Chris Paul in offensive rating in the NBA last season (126.0). While Gallinari is not Mbah a Moute on the defensive side of the ball, he is 100 times better on the offensive end.</p>
<p>When NBA fans look at the Clippers offseason, many see it as a disappointment because they lost one of the best point guards in the NBA. However, I look at their offseason as a step in the right direction. The team got younger, added more depth, and they still have two top-tier players: Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan. The Clippers have done enough this offseason to stay in the Western Conference Playoffs next year and start contending again shortly after that.</p>
