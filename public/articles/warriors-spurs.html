<p>As San Antonio throttled over the Rockets on Thursday night, it set up an intriguing one seed and two seed matchup. In the regular season the Warriors racked up 67 wins and the Spurs posted 61 wins. The Warriors received home court throughout the entire playoffs one season after being taken down by LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals. Now, they are back with a chance to go back to the Finals for what could possibly be another rematch with the Cavaliers. The Spurs of course are coming off a surprising exit against the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Semifinals. They are looking to get back to where Popovich and company know best: The NBA Finals.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Regular Season Background</b></h4>
<p>The Spurs and Warriors matched up three times in the regular season this year. The Spurs won two of the three games, one being on opening night. The Warriors took the final game of the season against the Spurs in San Antonio. The closest game they played was in the final game when the Warriors took down the Spurs by 12 points. So, none of the matchups this season have been particularly close, but why? There are a couple reasons as to why the regular season matchups were lopsided victories for either side. The first game of the season, the Spurs knocked off the Warriors by 29 points. This was Golden Stateâ€™s first game with Kevin Durant and one can make an argument that the team was just getting accustomed to a new star player joining the team. The second matchup in early March saw both teams resting key players, so neither team was at full strength. The final game between the two teams was possibly the most even match of the entire season. The Warriors came away with a twelve point win in spite of not having Kevin Durant due to injury.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Key Players</b></h4>
<p>Going into the series against Golden State, it is still unknown how healthy Kawhi Leonard will be. Leonard missed Game 6 against the Rockets due to a sore ankle. Leonard has said that he will be ready to suit up for Game 1 on Sunday, but it is still unknown just how healthy he will be. When healthy, Leonard has put up astonishing numbers this postseason and if San Antonio is to take down the Warriors, he will need to keep up his historic postseason. The Warriors on the other hand have four dynamic weapons and each one can lead the team to a win on any given night. Steph Curry is averaging 27.1 points per game and shooting 41% from downtown in the postseason. However, his splash brother, Klay Thompson, has had a rather quiet postseason. Thompson is averaging 16.1 points per game while shooting 36.2% from three point territory in the postseason. Draymond Green is putting on a show on the defensive end while grabbing 9.1 rebounds per game. But, perhaps the player that could decide the outcome of this series is LaMarcus Aldridge. Aldridge is averaging 16.8 points and 8 rebounds per game this postseason. When Aldridge is clicking, it seems very tough to slow down the Spurs. When Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge have their two man game working, consider the game to be over.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Prediction</b></h4>
<p>While many experts have chosen Golden State to run away with a decisive series win, I believe this series will be a hard fought series by both sides. In the end, the Warriors will come out on top in six games because of their sheer firepower and Kawhi Leonard not being able to defend every Warrior on the court.</p>
