<h1>2017-18 Wolves Season Preview Questions</h1>

<p><b>Question from @Gee_manLeo16: What position do you think we are lacking in?</b></p>
<p>Answer: While it is hard to pinpoint one specific position, one area I am still concerned about is the team’s three-point shooting. In order to make a big statement this season the Wolves will need knock-down shooters, and at the moment, I do not think we have that. The Wolves will be able to score the ball, but there are some instances in which a team needs three-point shooting in order to get back into games and put teams away down the stretch.</p>
<p><b>Question from @Lenzy2108: What do you see happening at backup point guard? Brooks or Tyus?</b></p>
<p>Answer: At least to start the season, it seems that Tyus will be in charge of leading the second unit, but that can change as the season progresses. Even though Tyus will get the first chance to secure the backup point guard spot, any sort of mishaps or bad play can change things very quickly.</p>
<p><b>Question from @KoKoPuffs29: With how skilled of an offense we will have, how concerned are we really about three-point shooting?</b></p>
<p>Answer: As I eluded to before, even though our offense will be able to put the ball in the basket, we do not have a guy that can sit on the outside and just knock down shots. There is a level of concern that we will eventually need a three-point specialist, but let’s see how the season starts, and maybe we can even rely on our defense a little bit.</p>
<p><b>Question from @YandTwinkwink: Do we make a midseason trade?</b></p>
<p>Answer: At this point, it is very hard to answer that question. Midseason trades are completely dependent on how the team performs in the first half of the season. However, if we do make a trade before the deadline, I would expect us to be adding someone and not dumping off a player for a pick.</p>
<p><b>Question from @DB_For_Three: Talk me through the improvements (and regressions) for Bazz and Dieng?</b></p>
<p>Answer: Well first off, hopefully we are not seeing any regressions from those two players, because at this point in their career, they should be improving and not regressing. One of the biggest storylines at media day and in training camp was how Shabazz Muhammad transformed his body this offseason. He came in much lighter, and he has said that he is in the best shape of his life. Hopefully that will result in him playing harder on the defensive end of the court and be more versatile on offense. For Gorgui, one area that he has continued to work on this offseason is his three-point shooting. He started shooting corner threes last season, and he was quite efficient in the few shots he attempted. As he slides to the bench, I expect him to heave up many more from downtown this season, and hopefully, he still connects at a high percentage.</p>
