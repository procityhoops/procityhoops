<p>Paul George has been rumored to be leaving Indiana when his contract expires in the summer of 2018. Now, Adrian Wojnarowski of the Vertical has confirmed it. Woj tweeted out that Paul George has informed the Indiana Pacers that he won’t resign with the team next offseason. Paul George intends to play out his contract with Indiana this season, but he wanted to give the Pacers a chance to make a plan to move on without him. Paul George prefers to play with his hometown Los Angeles Lakers after next season. The Lakers have been linked to George for many years, and Magic Johnson doesn’t want to waste his cap space this summer since he needs it next summer for George.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if any contender will take the risk and trade for George with no guarantee that he stays. The Boston Celtics just added another asset in a trade with the Sixers and could possibly trade for George. There is a possibility that George could fall in love with a team that trades for him, but it would be a huge risk. For Indiana, they need to get at least something in return for George. It would be a huge shame if an All-Star walked away and Indiana got nothing out of it. Stay tuned on our Twitter page for the most recent updates on George and other NBA happenings.</p>
