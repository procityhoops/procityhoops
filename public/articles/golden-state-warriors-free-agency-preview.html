<p>As everyone is aware of, Golden State won the 2017 NBA Finals and may have proven themselves as if not the best, one of the best teams in the history of the NBA. Kevin Durant signing with the Warriors last offseason was something thought to only be possible originally in My GM on 2k. However, Durant came in, put in the work, and fit seamlessly into the Warriors starting five. While Golden State will have more key decisions to make this offseason, expect Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green to run it back as they charge towards potentially their third title in four years.  </p>
<br>
<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $54 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: James McAdoo<br>
Unrestricted: Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, Stephen Curry, Shaun Livingston, Zaza Pachulia, David West, Javale McGee, Ian Clark, and Matt Barnes</p>
<p>Golden State has plenty of decisions to make this offseason. While both Curry and Durant are virtually locks to re-sign, the same cannot be said about key role players Shaun Livingston and Andre Iguodala. Early reports suggest that Iguodala and Livingston both prefer to return to the bay, but money talks in the NBA and both should receive larger contract opportunities to go elsewhere. Javale McGee, Zaza Pachulia and David West were all vital contributors to the Warriors frontcourt, and may look to re-sign for the minimum. If they do not, there should be plenty of suitors to take their place. James McAdoo and Ian Clark both offer intriguing potential this offseason and a middling team may overpay them due to their roles on a championship contender as well as their age. With the emergence of Patrick McCaw, look for Clark to sign elsewhere and cash in on his past experiences with the Warriors. </p>

<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Marreese Speights, Vince Carter </p>
<p>Much like the Cavaliers, the Warriors are not going to have any remaining cap space after signing Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, and potentially Andre Iguodala. Both Speights and Carter represent intriguing bench options who may be inclined to sign on for the minimum to win a championship. Carter was a revelation last year as well as a key contributor for a playoff team in Memphis. While Carter stands to make more money elsewhere, he may sign on for the minimum for the opportunity to win a championship and ride off into the proverbial sunset. Speights has experience with the Warriors and is familiar with the culture in the bay area. Speights could regain his role as first big off the bench and offer the same offensive upside he previously showed for the Warriors.</p>
