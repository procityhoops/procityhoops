<h1>NBA Mock Draft 1.0</h1>

<p><b>1. Celtics (via BKN): Markelle Fultz, G, Washington</b></p>
<p>The Celtics fans should be thanking former Nets General Manager Billy King every day. Boston was just defeated by the Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Finals and they now also own the #1 pick in the 2017 NBA Draft. Fultz will provide the Celtics with immediate help next to Isaiah Thomas. Fultz will score in bunches and give Thomas a break on the offensive end. Markelle Fultz will also be able to add to the Celtics young core of Jaylen Brown and Jae Crowder. Fultz is the logical pick for the Celtics at #1.</p>

<p><b>2. Lakers: Lonzo Ball, G, UCLA</b></p>
<p>The Lakers and Magic Johnson got lucky on the night of the NBA Draft Lottery. The Lakers kept their pick, and they moved up one spot to select #2. Magic Johnson seems enamored with Lonzo Ball, and he does not seem to have a problem with Lonzo’s father. Ball will add to the Lakers’ young core and will be a pivotal piece for many years moving forward. Some scouts are worried about his shooting form, but there is no doubt he can facilitate the basketball.</p>

<br><br>
<p><b>3. 76ers: De’Aaron Fox, G, Kentucky</b></p>
<p>The 76ers are sitting in a very good spot at pick three. “Trust the process” was in full effect last season and the pick of De’Aaron Fox will only add to it. Ben Simmons will also make his NBA debut in the 2017-2018 season and the 76ers need a floor general to keep the machine running. Fox can do just that. He averaged 4.6 assists per game last year for Kentucky, and he showed great skill finishing at the rim. With Fox, Simmons, and Embiid there is no saying how good the Sixers may be in a couple of years.</p>

<p><b>4. Suns: Josh Jackson, F, Kansas</b></p>
<p>On NBA Draft Lottery night, the Phoenix Suns dropped two spots to #4. But, on the bright side, the Suns will still come away with a very good player. Jackson will provide the Suns a very reliable option for many years. Devin Booker needs another player that can score the ball. Jackson averaged 16.3 points per game for Kansas last season, and he will develop into a solid player in the NBA alongside Devin Booker.</p>

<p><b>5. Kings (via PHI): Jayson Tatum, F, Duke</b></p>
<p>The Kings have a big problem. They unloaded an all-star center because their owner finally let them. Luckily for Kings fans, Sacramento will be picking fifth and tenth in a loaded 2017 NBA Draft. In the fifth spot, the Kings will have a chance to select Jayson Tatum out of Duke. Tatum will be able to mesh with Buddy Hield and help jump-start the Kings rebuild. Last week, Jayson Tatum’s trainer, Drew Hanlen, posted a video of Tatum knocking down the long range ball. That was the biggest knock on Tatum’s game and if he figures it out, watch out NBA.</p>

<p><b>6. Magic: Malik Monk, G, Kentucky</b></p>
<p>Malik Monk is considered one of the best pure shooters in the draft. The Magic have had a tendency to take foreign players over the last couple of years, but this year they will have a chance at one of the top shooting prospects in the draft. Monk will be a good building stone in Orlando to start a rebuild.</p>

<br><br>
<p><b>7. Timberwolves: Jonathan Isaac, F, Florida State</b></p>
<p>As far as expectations go, the Timberwolves had one of the more disappointing 2016-2017 seasons. They picked up their play in the final months of the season, but a big reason for them being unable to make the progress they wanted was their defense. Isaac gives the Timberwolves a player that can come in and contribute right away on the defensive end. Isaac is also considered to have one of the highest potentials in the draft.</p>

<p><b>8. Knicks: Dennis Smith Jr., G, NC State</b></p>
<p>Phil Jackson and the Knicks have a number of tasks on the agenda this offseason. The first one will be their selection at #8 in the draft. Dennis Smith Jr. would give the Knicks a young point guard that they have so long desired. Smith posted 18.1 points and 6.2 assists per game in his freshman season at NC State. Smith could slide right into the starting point guard role and help Kristaps Porzingis rebuild the Knicks.</p>

<p><b>9. Mavericks: Frank Ntilikina, G, France</b></p>
<p>The Mavericks have been a wildcard type of team for a number of years now. Some years they will make the playoffs and contend, other years they will be in the lottery. The Dallas Mavericks have a knack for international players in the draft. Of course, they have the great Dirk Nowitzki from Germany, and the selection of Ntilikina will get the Mavericks back on the right track to return to the playoffs. Ntilikina shot 43.1% from three-point range last season and would give the Mavericks a weapon at guard.</p>

<p><b>10. Kings (via NOP): Lauri Markkanen, F, Arizona</b></p>
<p>Some people argue that Lauri Markkanen may be the next Dirk Nowitzki. That may not be true, but Markkanen can play. The Kings- having already selected Jayson Tatum- need to find a big man that can develop and try to replace DeMarcus Cousins. Markkanen would be given the opportunity to start right away and should be able to slide in nicely next to Tatum and Hield, creating a nice young core in Sacramento.</p>

<p><b>11. Hornets: Zach Collins, C, Gonzaga</b></p>
<p>The Charlotte Hornets had a sub-par 2016-2017 season. A year after taking the Heat to seven games in the opening round of the playoffs, the Hornets missed out on the postseason completely. With the Hornets having a number of veteran players on their roster, they need someone who can help right away. Zach Collins would be able to come in right away and cause havoc for the opposing offense and defense. The Hornets have a gap at the center position, and with the selection of Collins, the Hornets should be back in the postseason next year.</p>

<p><b>12. Pistons: Justin Jackson, F, North Carolina</b></p>
<p>The Detroit Pistons barely missed out on the postseason this season. Andre Drummond did all he could to help the Pistons fight for the playoffs, but he came up short. The selection of Justin Jackson would put the Pistons over the hump. Jackson is a fundamentally sound player that understands the game of basketball. The Pistons are often caught out of place, and Jackson’s knowledge would really benefit the team.</p>

<img src="/assets/images/Slideshow/Tatum-Jackson.jpg">
<br><br>
<p><b>13. Nuggets: Harry Giles, F, Duke</b></p>
<p>Nikola Jokic led the Nuggets to a 40-42 record in the 2016-2017 season. Unfortunately, Denver fell one game short of the postseason. Harry Giles is a wildcard selection. He only played 11.5 minutes per game for Duke last season and has injury concerns, but the upside is unlimited. With a team that came so close to the postseason last year, taking a flyer on a high-risk, high-reward player might be beneficial.</p>

<p><b>14. Heat: Donovan Mitchell, G, Louisville</b></p>
<p>The Heat put together a historic turnaround that came up just short last season. Donovan Mitchell would allow the Heat to give Goran Dragic a break from handling the ball. Eric Spoelstra could play Mitchell at the shooting guard next to Goran Dragic, and it would space the offense out. Mitchell also has extreme athleticism that would help Miami on the defensive end. Mitchell doubled almost every stat category from his freshman to sophomore season at Louisville, and if keeps up that progression, the Heat are looking at a contributing player at pick 14.</p>

<p><b>15. Trail Blazers: OG Anunoby, F, Indiana</b></p>
<p>The trade for Jusuf Nurkic put the Blazers over the hump in the second half of last season. The Blazers came away with the eight seed in the West but then got throttled by the Golden State Warriors in the first round of the playoffs. The Blazers lacked a third option in the series against the Warriors. Anunoby showed potential to be a scoring threat in the NBA last season at Indiana. Anunoby averaged 11.1 points per game while attempting only 7.6 field goals per game. Anunoby could develop into the third option for the Blazers, but at the very least, he will be a solid defender.</p>

<p><b>16. Bulls: Luke Kennard, G, Duke</b></p>
<p>When Rajon Rondo went down with an injury, the Bulls were leading the top-seeded Celtics in the first round of the playoffs. After Rondo got hurt, they did not win another game in the series. The selection of Luke Kennard will give the Bulls a solid role player to come off the bench and start when needed. Kennard can score from anywhere on the floor and can shoot the lights out. Kennard averaged 19.5 points per game for Duke last season, and his scoring ability is why he will be highly coveted in this draft.</p>

<p><b>17. Bucks: Jarrett Allen, C, Texas</b></p>
<p>The Bucks, led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, took the Toronto Raptors to seven games in the opening round of the 2017 NBA Playoffs. Had Jabari Parker not been injured, Milwaukee might have been the Cavaliers second round opponent. The Bucks are not particularly a big team and often get destroyed on the glass. The selection of Jarrett Allen will give the Bucks a center who can rebound and block shots on the defensive end.</p>

<img src="/assets/images/Slideshow/Jarrett-Allen.jpg">
<br><br>
<p><b>18. Pacers: John Collins, F, Wake Forest</b></p>
<p>The Indiana Pacers are a mess. They lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round of the 2017 playoffs and now face rumors that Paul George might leave for the Lakers next offseason. John Collins would provide the Pacers a reliable inside option next to Myles Turner. Collins is a tremendous rebounder and a terrific inside scorer. If George decides to leave, the Pacers will have a jump-start on their rebuild with the selection of Collins.</p>

<p><b>19. Hawks: Ivan Rabb, F, California</b></p>
<p>Last season, scouts were positive that Ivan Rabb would declare for the draft. Rabb decided to stay in school and get one more year of college experience under his belt. Rabb is an athletic big man that has great finishing abilities. If he can work on his outside jump shot, Rabb has the potential to be a solid starter in the NBA.</p>

<p><b>20. Trail Blazers (via MEM): Ike Anigbogu, C, UCLA</b></p>
<p>At pick #14, the Blazers selected OG Anunoby out of Indiana. With the 20th pick, the Blazers will need to keep adding to the depth of their frontcourt. Ike Anigbogu is a young, athletic center that can learn and mature under the teaching of Jusuf Nurkic. Anigbogu is by no means a finished product, but his potential is off the charts.</p>

<p><b>21. Thunder: T.J. Leaf, F, UCLA</b></p>
<p>Russell Westbrook was a man among boys last season. Westbrook put up historic numbers, but he did not get the help he needed to make a playoff run. T.J. Leaf will be able to come in right away and take some of the offensive pressure off Westbrook. Leaf averaged 16.3 points and 8.2 rebounds per game in his freshman season at UCLA. Leaf has the ability to play inside and out on the offensive end, and he will be a weapon for Oklahoma City from day one.</p>

<p><b>22. Nets (via WSH): Justin Patton, C, Creighton</b></p>
<p>Thanks to Billy King, the Brooklyn Nets first pick on draft night will be at #22 and not #1. The Nets, at this point, are awful and have no picks to show for it. The selection of the lengthy big man out of Creighton will give Patton a chance to learn from one of the Nets’ few good players, Brook Lopez. Patton might need to spend some time in the D-League in his rookie season, but the Nets can afford to take a player with Patton’s upside.</p>

<p><b>23. Raptors (via LAC): Tyler Lydon, F, Syracuse</b></p>
<p>The Raptors cannot seem to get over the hump in the Eastern Conference. They were swept by the Cavaliers in the 2017 playoffs and are now left wondering what to do. It is possible the Raptors could lose Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka this summer, and if that happens, DeMar DeRozan will need some help. Tyler Lydon would provide the Raptors a solid offensive player that can stretch the floor. Lydon needs some work defensively, but there is no doubt that he can contribute offensively instantly.</p>

<img src="/assets/images/Slideshow/Tyler-Lydon.jpg">
<br><br>
<p><b>24. Jazz: Terrance Ferguson, G, Australia</b></p>
<p>Rumors have been swirling about the possibility of Gordon Hayward leaving Utah to join the Boston Celtics. If the Jazz are truly worried about Hayward leaving, Terrance Ferguson would be a nice player to step into his role. Ferguson is a high flying, sharp shooter with unlimited potential. He needs to get more physical on both ends of the floor and improve his midrange game, but the endless potential is enticing. </p>

<p><b>25. Magic (via TOR): Rodions Kurucs, F, Latvia</b></p>
<p>Rodions Kurucs is a tremendous offensive player with great size for a small forward. Kurucs has all the intangibles that you look for in an NBA small forward, and if it were not for two major injuries, he may be a top-15 pick in this draft.</p>

<p><b>26. Trail Blazers (via CLE): Isaiah Hartenstein, F, Germany</b></p>
<p>Isaiah Hartenstein has come onto many team’s radars over the last months. The Blazers, of course, have three first round picks in this draft and many experts figure that at least one of the picks will be a developmental player. The Blazers could stick Isaiah Hartenstein in the D-League and wait for him to develop. He has great size for a forward but needs to work on his offensive game.</p>

<p><b>27. Nets (via BOS): D.J. Wilson, F, Michigan</b></p>
<p>D.J. Wilson is coming off his best year for Michigan. He averaged 11 points per game last season and is now declared for the NBA Draft. Wilson will provide the Nets with shooting at a forward position, and Wilson will be able to come in right away and develop himself in the NBA.</p>

<p><b>28. Lakers (via HOU): Bam Adebayo, C, Kentucky</b></p>
<p>With their first selection in the draft, the Lakers took Lonzo Ball. Now, the Lakers will need a big man to compliment Ball. Adebayo is a raw big man from Kentucky that is a serious defensive force. Adebayo will be able to step in immediately and contribute defensively, then, he will need to focus on improving his offensive skillset.</p>

<p><b>29. Spurs: Anzejs Pasecniks, C, Latvia</b></p>
<p>After the injury to Kawhi Leonard in the Western Conference Finals, the Spurs were doomed. They were swept by the Warriors and now have to find a way to improve enough to defeat Golden State next season. Pasecniks provides the Spurs with some great size down low, and he will just need some time to develop. Pasecniks will be able to develop under the leadership of all the vets in San Antonio and under the masterful Gregg Popovich.</p>

<p><b>30. Jazz (via GSW): Jonathan Jeanne, C, Guadeloupe</b></p>
<p>Rudy Gobert 2.0? Jonathan Jeanne is an athletic freak with tremendous shot blocking ability. He has extreme quickness for a player of his size and can get out and run on fast breaks. The one area that Jeanne needs work is on the offensive side of the ball. Other than dunks, Jeanne is not that great of an offensive player, but the potential is there.</p>
