<p>Gordon Hayward is arguably one of the most coveted free agents this offseason. Hayward averaged 21.9 points and 5.4 rebounds per game in the 2016-2017 season which were both career-highs. The Jazz defeated the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the 2017 NBA Playoffs, but they were swept by the juggernaut of the West in the second round. The Boston Celtics have been rumored to go “all in” on Hayward this offseason, but now, the Jazz seem to have another team to worry about. Marc Stein of ESPN reports that the Jazz are just as concerned that Hayward will bolt to Miami this offseason. Of course, Miami didn’t make the 2017 NBA Playoffs, but teaming up with Hassan Whiteside could be very enticing for Hayward. Although Hayward may bolt to the East, the Jazz would be able to offer Hayward an extra year and about $50-million-plus more in a designated player extension. The 2017 offseason will be filled with numerous fireworks, and this is just one story to keep an eye on.</p>
