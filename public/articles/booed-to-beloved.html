<h1>Booed to Beloved</h1>

<p>Believe it or not, sometimes I enjoy being wrong.  Now and again it doesn’t irritate me that I am not an omniscient being with incomprehensible sports knowledge.  These times are rare of course, and anyone who knows me will tell you that.  However, certain times being wrong gives me as much as joy as being right.   For instance, I thought the show Marvel’s Agents of Shield would be a tremendous flop, and here it is going into its fifth season.  For those of you who don’t watch, I recommend it.  It’s a slow starter, but give it some time.  It was a pleasant surprise, and I couldn’t have been happier to be wrong.  Not too many people know this about me, but I really like the New York Knicks.  I love New York City, Madison Square Garden, and have always wanted the Knicks to succeed.  So when the New York Knicks selected the skinny 7-foot jump shooter from Latvia, I booed and ultimately laughed at how stupid this pick was.  Praise the basketball gods I was wrong.</p>
<p>After the draft I remember talking to my dad about it.  I told him how Porzingis is just going to be another soft European player with a smooth jumper.  I thought this tall skinny dude just simply wouldn’t cut it, and Phil Jackson was foolish for drafting him.  Now this may have been the one right thing Jackson did in his time in New York, but I remember my dad saying to pause and hold judgment until I see him play.  See, like all of those Knick fans who booed Kristaps on draft night, I had never seen him play a game.  What has happened since then is the skinny 7-footer from Latvia is the King of New York and taking the league by storm.</p>
<p>Kristaps at this point in the young season is putting up 27 points and grabbing 7 boards while shooting over 46% from the floor and 39% from three.  However, putting up these All-NBA numbers at age 22 isn’t the story.  The story is this young kid has the Knicks winning games and being one of the most watchable teams in the league.  Yes, the Knicks have started okay the last couple of seasons.  They were .500 through mid-January his rookie season and started 16-14 last season before crumbling beneath all of the controversies surrounding the organization.  This season is different.  A changing of the guard has occurred.  It’s infectious and ravaging through the team and the city.  Porzingis said it himself; “I think we have a better connection as a team this year.”</p>
<p>Playing with passion and energy night in and night out in the NBA is hard.  Consistently bringing that passion each game is uncommon.  Porzingis has his team bringing that passion each game.  The Knicks are spreading the ball around while making each other better, and it all starts with number 6.  I can confidently say I thought the Knicks would be a disaster this year.  The roster looked well below average.  Porzingis wasn’t ready to carry a team I said.  I was wrong.  Not only is he ready, but he is doing it right now.</p>
<p>Kristaps represents perhaps the greatest evolution in basketball.  This giant and freakishly long center stepping out away from the basket knocking down threes, racing up and down the floor, moving all around the court and simply terrorizing teams outside in.  He moves so well for a man his size.  It only seems fitting that a talent so transcendent ends up in the greatest city in the world.  Porzingis has New York back as an attractive landing spot for free agents.  He has Knick fans bubbling with joy over thoughts of how great he will soon be.  He has the Knicks winning games.  Leading them to the playoffs is a goal I’m sure he has, and it’s a goal he will accomplish this season.  The future isn’t coming folks, the future is here.</p>
