<h1>Rudy Gobert leading Utah to the Playoffs</h1>

<p>When Gordon Hayward left the Utah Jazz last summer, nobody would have predicted that the Jazz sit where they currently sit in the Western Conference. Sitting sixth in the Western Conference playoffs, the Utah Jazz are exceeding expectations. Yes, they have gotten a ton of production out of potential NBA Rookie of the Year, Donovan Mitchell. Yes, they have one of the best coaches in the NBA. But, the biggest reason the Jazz are where they are is because of Rudy Gobert. Gobert was hurt for a good chunk of the season, but in the games that he has played this season, the Jazz are 33-18. That leaves the Jazz with a record of 11-15 without Gobert this year. Do you remember the 11-game winning streak the Jazz went on in late January through the middle of February? Rudy Gobert played in every single one of those contests. How about the 4-11 stretch the Jazz went on from the middle of December to the middle of January? Rudy Gobert was out for that entire stretch. The point has been made, Rudy Gobert is vital to Utah’s success, but just how vital?</p>
<p>To say that Gobert is the heart of the Jazz might be an understatement. He is the glue for Utah’s biggest strength: their defense. Gobert is averaging 2.3 blocks per game this season, and the Jazz are holding opposing teams to a 100.8 offensive rating when Gobert is on the floor this season. Aside from the blocks, Gobert alters so many other shots in the paint. Watching several Jazz games throughout the past month, opponents will often drive into the lane on Utah just to throw up a crazy shot in the paint because Gobert is there to make them adjust. Check out the semi-recent clip below of Gobert blocking three shots in one minute against the Minnesota Timberwolves. The first block was called for a goaltend, but these blocks give people an idea of just how important Gobert is in the lane.</p>

<p>Opposite of the defensive side of the ball, Rudy Gobert is no joke on the offensive end either. Gobert is averaging 13.7 points per game this season on just eight shots per contest. Gobert is terrific at going up and catching lobs from Ricky Rubio, and he excels at getting second-chance points. Gobert is grabbing 2.89 offensive rebounds per game this season, making him one of the best offensive rebounders in the NBA. While Gobert can improve as a passer and add to his post moves, he is an elite talent on the offensive glass and finishing off lobs from his guards.</p>
<p>Rudy Gobert is one of the most underrated players in the NBA. After Hayward left the Jazz in free agency, the bulk of the NBA has stopped paying attention to the Utah Jazz. But, the Jazz, sixth in the Western Conference, are on a late season run, and they are led by their seven-foot beast down low.</p>
