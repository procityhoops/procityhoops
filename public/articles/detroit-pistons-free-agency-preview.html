<h1>Detroit Pistons Free Agency Preview</h1>

<p>One year after making the playoffs, the Detroit Pistons were on the outside looking in. The Pistons finished the 2016-2017 NBA season at 37-45 which placed them 10th in the East. The Pistons had a very average team that was capable of winning games, but they couldn’t put it together. Tobias Harris led the Pistons in scoring, averaging 16.1 points per game, but his play throughout the season was very inconsistent. Andre Drummond took a step backward last season and has found himself on the trade block in the recent months. He averaged 13.6 points and 13.8 rebounds per game, which by no means are bad numbers, but considering he put up 16.2 points and 14.8 rebounds per game the year before, it was a step backward. Reggie Jackson, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Jon Leuer also played key roles in the 2016-2017 season for the Pistons. Last Thursday night, the Detroit Pistons selected Luke Kennard in the 2017 NBA Draft. Kennard is a sniper from three-point territory who will give the Pistons a threat from the outside. The Pistons will now turn their attention to free agency where they will try to find quality players to get them back into the postseason.</p>

<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $1.5 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: Reggie Bullock, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope<br>
Unrestricted: Aron Baynes, Beno Udrih</p>
<p>The Detroit Pistons have one of their main contributors hitting the restricted free agency market this summer. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope averaged 13.8 points for the Pistons last season, and he is just 24 years old. The Pistons will have the opportunity to match any offer for Caldwell-Pope, and it will likely be a very big one. A team like the Brooklyn Nets might offer Caldwell-Pope a four-year max contract in hopes of Detroit not matching the contract. With the Pistons not having many guards to build around the way it is, Caldwell-Pope showed enough potential last season to keep him around at any cost. The other three free agents for the Pistons shouldn’t be a worry to them. They should save some cap space instead and focus on adding veterans to help the team win. The only way the Pistons should bring these players back is if they are on very cheap contracts. Otherwise, let them walk and find minutes elsewhere.</p>

<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Terrence Jones, Anthony Tolliver</p>
<p>The Detroit Pistons will not have the cap space this offseason to sign a top-tier free agent. However, there are still solid options as teams slide down the list of free agents. Terrence Jones was waived twice last season. He didn’t find a home last season, but he is a very good player when he does have a home and is able to settle in. As for Anthony Tolliver, he would be another cheap option for a backup power forward. Tolliver is a very hard worker and is a great locker room guy. Tolliver also hit 39.1% of his three-point attempts last season. Both options would be able to provide some size and versatility at the power forward position. The Pistons aren’t very deep in the frontcourt, and these guys would add to that depth. </p>
