<h1>Brooklyn Nets Free Agency Preview</h1>

<p>The Brooklyn Nets finished the 2016-2017 NBA season with an NBA-worst record of 20-62. Worse yet, they didn’t have their pick. So, the Nets are the worst team in the league, and they don’t have their pick to show for it. The Nets lone bright spot last season was Brook Lopez, but now, he’s a member of the Los Angeles Lakers. Fortunately for the Nets, they got D’Angelo Russell back from the Lakers who was the former second overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft. Russell gives the Nets a solid young guy to try and start building in the right direction. However, with no picks and an awful team, how can the Nets improve in this year’s free agency?</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $35 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: K.J. McDaniels<br>
Unrestricted: Randy Foye</p>
<p>The Brooklyn Nets don’t have any names from their current roster to worry about in free agency. They need to let Randy Foye walk and go play for a contending team because he won’t get that anytime soon in Brooklyn. As for K.J. McDaniels, he is just 24 years old and averaged 6.3 points per game in 14.7 minutes per night for the Nets in 2016-2017. It would be smart for the Nets to offer McDaniels a small contract, and if he signs it, great, if not, move on.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Otto Porter Jr.</p>
<p>Both of the Nets free agent targets are restricted free agents. But, that’s okay. The Nets can offer both players max contracts and hope that their current team doesn’t match the deal. Caldwell-Pope would give the Nets a young scorer who is just 24 years old. Caldwell-Pope still has a lot of potential and getting out of Detroit could possibly help him revive his career. Otto Porter Jr., on the other hand, is a lockdown defender who is just starting to realize his offensive potential. He is also 24 years old, but he shot 43.4% from three-point range last season. He also averaged 13.4 points per game as the third option on a high-scoring Wizards team. Think about what he could do as the first or second option on this Nets team. Both guys would be extremely expensive, but getting another young talent to pair with D’Angelo Russell would be well worth it.</p>
