<h1>Early NBA Mock Draft</h1>
<div id="author">
<p>By: Jake Olsonoski</p>

<p>1) Boston Celtics (From Brooklyn Nets) – Lonzo Ball (FR), Point Guard, UCLA: Ball has taken
UCLA and the country by storm early on in his freshman season. Ball has an uncanny ability to
get his teammates involved and has proven to be a better shooter than originally advertised.
Fultz is the number one prospect available, but Ball’s skill set may prove to be more valuable to
Boston. Lonzo can play off the ball some with Isaiah Thomas and can offset Thomas size on
defense. While Fultz potential may be too hard to pass up, Ball would give Boston the most pro-
ready player in this years draft.</p>
<br>
<p>2) Philadelphia 76ers- Markelle Fultz (FR), Point Guard, Washington: Fultz is the most talented
player in this years draft. Fultz has shown the ability to fill the stat sheet leading all freshman in
scoring with 22.3 points per game to go along with 6.1 rebounds per as well as 6.5 assists. Fultz
has the potential to fill the stat sheet in the NBA and would become Philly’s starting point guard
from day one.</p>
<br>
<p>3) Dallas Mavericks- Dennis Smith (FR), Point Guard, North Carolina State: Smith’s impact on
the wolfpack this season has been undeniable. His athletic ability and energy will translate well
to the next level and would give Dallas someone to build around in the post-Dirk Nowitzki era.
Smith’s ability to rebound from a torn ACL in his senior season has been impressive and he has
shown no signs of the injury this season. Smith is averaging 19.6 points, 4.1 rebounds and 6.5
assists per game.</p>
<br>
<p>4) Phoenix Suns- Josh Jackson (FR), Small Forward, Kansas: Jackson was the number one
prospect in the land prior to this season. Jackson has played well for the Jayhawks, but the
previous three prospects have had a greater impact on college basketball to date. With that
being said, Jackson has shown the intangibles and abilities that made him the #1 prospect in the
class, and he will only continue to improve as the season progresses. Phoenix needs to continue
to acquire talent, and his skill set would look nice in a starting lineup featuring Eric Bledsoe and
Devin Booker.</p>
<br>
<p>5) Miami Heat- Frank Ntilkina (Int’l), Point Guard, France: Ntilkina is this years version of
Austin Powers, the international man of mystery. Ntilkina shined at the recent U18 euro
championship being named tournament MVP. Ntilkina stands 6’5” and is an imposing defender
with his nearly 7-foot wingspan. As he continues to fill out his frame, Ntilkina has offensive
tools that translate well to the NBA. Miami is looking to add talent to a roster that is suddenly
bare, and Ntilkina offers intriguing upside.</p>
<br>
<p>6) Minnesota Timberwolves: Jayson Tatum (FR), Combo Forward, Duke: Starting off, I fully
expect Tom Thibodeau to try and deal this pick. Minnesota is littered with young talent and
they need veteran leadership more than adding another young piece. With that being said,
Tatum has shown the ability to score this season at Duke and is an intriguing stretch 4 option
next to Karl Towns. Tatum could also come off the bench and play small forward with the
second unit. Tatum would give the Timberwolves another young and extremely talented
prospect. Tatum is averaging 16.7 points, 7.4 rebounds and 2.4 assets per game.</p>
<br>
<p>7) Philadelphia 76ers (From Los Angeles Lakers: Malik Monk (FR), Shooting Guard, Kentucky:
This is a dream scenario for the 76ers. In drafting Monk and Fultz, they add talent to a deprived
backcourt. Monk and Fultz will start from day one, and their games fit well with Ben Simmons
and Joel Embiid. Monk is a deadeye shooter and the best pure scorer in the draft. He is
shooting 43% from three this season and averaging 22.6 points per game for the Wildcats. In
this scenario, Philly wins draft night. Trust the process.</p>
<br>
<p>8) New Orleans Pelicans: De’Aaron Fox (FR), Point Guard, Kentucky: Monk’s backcourt mate
doesn’t have to wait long to hear his name called. Fox has an impressive ability to get to the rim
and involve his teammates in the game night in and night out. New Orleans desperately needs
to add talent around Anthony Davis, and they use John Calipari to add another piece in the
Bayou. Fox and Buddy Hield would complement each other well, and Anthony Davis finally gets
some much-needed help. Fox is averaging 15 points, 5 rebounds and nearly 7 assists per game.</p>
<br>
<p>9) Denver Nuggets: Jonathan Isaac (FR), Combo Forward, Florida State: Isaac has been
impressive this season for Florida State. While he does not play as much as other freshman, he
fills an important role for the veteran-laden Seminoles. While Dever is another prime candidate
to trade their pick, Isaac offers another intriguing talent to the Mile High City. Isaac is averaging
12 points and 7 rebounds per game.</p>
<br>
<p>10) Orlando Magic: Harry Giles (FR), Power Forward, Duke: Giles was the consensus #1
prospect in the class until his second knee injury. Had Giles never gotten hurt, he would be the
surefire #1 pick in this year's draft. With that being said, Giles has an extensive injury history
during his teenage years, and this will scare many teams off early in the lottery. With pick
number 10, Orlando has the ability to take the risk and possibly secure the best player in this
class late in the lottery. In limited minutes, Giles has averaged 4 points and 6 rebounds per
game.</p>
<br>
<p>11) Detroit Pistons: OG Anunoby (Soph), Small Forward, Indiana: Anunoby is a prototypical 3
and D in todays NBA. Anunoby is a lockdown defender on the wing and will be able to
contribute to most teams from day one. Detroit is looking for the best player available, and
Anunoby offers that at pick number 11. OG is one year removed from shooting 43% from three
while defending every teams best offensive player each night. Anunoby is averaging 12 points
and 6 rebounds per game this season.</p>
<br>
<p>12) Washington Wizards: Lauri Makkanen (FR), Power Forward, Arizona: Markkanen is the
first true big man off the board in this mock draft. While Giles and Tatum were previously
selected, neither possess the same low post ability as Markkanen. Markannen will need to add
weight to his frame in order to be successful down low, but his skill set is similar to that of
Kristaps Porzingis. Washington does not have a direct need going into next season, so they take
the best player available at this point in Markkanen. Markkanen is averaging 15 points and 8
rebounds per game this season while shooting 43% from deep.</p>
<br>
<p>13) New York Knicks: Miles Bridges (FR), Combo Forward, Michigan State: Bridges slides to the
back end of the lottery due to his recent bout with a foot injury. If Bridges proves to be healthy
in the second half of the season, he has the ability to move into the top 10. Bridges has been
Michigan State’s best player this season when healthy. The Knicks take the opportunity here to
draft Carmelo’s potential replacement plan and add another young piece next to Porzingis.
Bridges is averaging 16 points, 8 rebounds and 2 assists per game while shooting 48% from the
floor.</p>
<br>
<p>14) Portland Trailblazers: Ivan Rabb (Soph), Power Forward, California: Rabb would have been
a lottery pick had he entered the draft after his freshman season. Rabb has played well without
Jaylen Brown but has not taken the leap many expected after an impressive freshman season.
Portland desperately needs help down low, and Rabb gives them a potential starter from day
one. Rabb is averaging 15 points and 11 rebounds per game this season.</p>
<br>
<p>15) Sacramento Kings: Dwayne Bacon, Shooting Guard, Florida State (FR).</p>
<br>
<p>16) Chicago Bulls: Robert Williams, Power Forward, Texas A&M (FR).</p>
<br>
<p>17) Indiana Pacers: Bam Adebayo, Center, Kentucky (FR).</p>
<br>
<p>18) Milwaukee Bucks: TJ Leaf, Power Forward, UCLA (FR).</p>
<br>
<p>19) Atlanta Hawks: Isaiah Hartenstein, Power Forward, Zalgris Kaunas Lithuania, (Int’l)</p>
<br>
<p>20) Charlotte Hornets: Luke Kennard, Shooting Guard, Duke (FR).</p>
<br>
<p>21) Brooklyn Nets (From Boston Celtics): Terrance Ferguson, Shooting Guard, Adelaide 36ers

Australia (Int’l)</p>
<br>
<p>22) Oklahoma City Thunder: Marques Bolden, Center, Duke (FR).</p>
<br>
<p>23) Denver Nuggets (From Memphis Grizzlies) Rodions Kurucs, Small Forward, Barcelona
(Int’l)</p>
<br>
<p>24) Toronto Raptors (From LA Clippers): Thomas Bryant, Center, Indiana (Soph).</p>
<br>
<p>25) Utah Jazz: Tyler Lydon, Combo Forward, Syracuse (Soph).</p>
<br>
<p>26) Toronto Raptors: Edmond Sumner, Point Guard, Xavier (Soph).</p>
<br>
<p>27) Houston Rockets: Jaron Blossomgame, Small Forward, Clemson (SR)</p>
<br>
<p>28) San Antonio Spurs: Anzejs Pasecniks, Center, Gran Canaria (Int’l).</p>
<br>
<p>29) Cleveland Cavaliers: Josh Hart, Shooting Guard, Villanova (SR).</p>
<br>
<p>30) Utah Jazz (From Golden State): Cam Oliver, Power Forward, Nevada (Soph).</p>
<br>
