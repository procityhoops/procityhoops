<p>The Cavaliers finished the 2016-2017 season with a record of 51-31, good enough for the second seed in the Eastern Conference. Cleveland proceeded to run through the Eastern Conference which ended in the third straight Finals appearance against the Golden State Warriors, where they later fell in game five. This offseason has already been filled with turmoil in the form of firing GM David Griffin. Griffin constructed this current version of the Cavs by trading for Kevin Love, drafting Kyrie Irving and Tristan Thompson and later signing LeBron James. After numerous efforts to add to their current core, Clevelandâ€™s roster looks the same as it did in the Finals with nearly no cap space to make any splashes in free agency. Cleveland will continue to try and trade for Paul George, or fall back and attempt to make a run at Carmelo Anthony or Dwyane Wade if bought out. </p>
<br>
<h4><b>Max Cap Space: -$30 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: None<br>
Unrestricted: James Jones, Derrick Williams, Dahntay Jones, Kyle Korver, and Deron Williams</p>
<p>With no current members set to hit restricted free agency, Cleveland will need to keep their unrestricted free agents if they choose to run it back with the same roster. James Jones and Dahntay Jones should be gone this offseason unless they are brought back for the veteran minimum after free agency. Derrick Williams, the former number two pick in the NBA Draft, showed signs of life this past season, and may command a higher salary than last season. If this is the case, he is as good as gone. While Deron Williams disappeared in the Finals, he was a solid backup addition to the roster and may be willing to sign on for the veteran minimum to chase another ring. Korver, on the other hand, should have a great amount of suitors this offseason. If the Cavs so choose, they can let Korver walk if the dollar amount raises higher than they would prefer to pay. However, Korver would be welcomed back with open arms if he chooses to return. </p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Matt Barnes, Jose Calderon </p>
<p>With little to no cap room, Cleveland will have limited options in free agency. What they do have going for them however is the allure of playing with LeBron James. Free agents flock to LeBron and usually take minimal contracts to do so. Adding Matt Barnes would give Cleveland another hardnose veteran on the wing. Barnes may also become a key piece if the Cavs choose to move on from either Iman Shumpert or J.R. Smith. Jose Calderon, offers a veteran backup point guard that should be able to give them more than Williams was able to in the playoffs. The caveat to free agency will be waiver pickups made either before or in the middle of the season. If bought out, look for Cleveland to make a run at adding Carmelo Anthony or Dwyane Wade.</p>
