<p>Darren Wolfson is a sports reporter for KSTP in Minnesota. He covers all Minnesota sports, but focuses on the Minnesota Timberwolves. Follow him on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/DWolfsonKSTP">@DWolfsonKSTP.</a> We are thrilled to discuss the Timberwolves offseason and the NBA Draft with Darren.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Q: It seems like Thibs and Layden have been harder for the media to get a sense of what they are thinking. What are the advantages and disadvantages of leaking information to the media for a team?</p></b>
<p>Wolfson: Typically, it's a you-scratch-my-back, I scratch yours mentality. So if a team leaks me something, they are hoping I have info that can help them. Another reason for leakage: to gain leverage. Example: float a player being on the trade block to a reporter to see what new offers come in. I'm clearly slanted toward gathering info, and for teams/sources to hand out info, so I don't see too many negatives. But two very successful organizations in the Spurs and Thunder are very tight-lipped. It's a copycat league, and the Wolves' front office has a Spurs influence. In other words, being like the CIA works for them.</p>

<p><b>Q: How relieving is it for the Wolves to be coming in to a second year under Thibs? Seems like the first offseason in a long time where the team knows the coach for the next season.</p>
</b>
<p>Wolfson: You just said it. From Adelman to Flip to Mitchell to Thibs is a lot for guys like Rubio, Muhammad, and Dieng, and for others three coaches in three years, or two in two years. And make no mistake: Mitchell ran a lot of different stuff from Flip. I'm a believer that continuity, especially with defensive concepts, is a good thing.</p>

<p><b>Q: Are there any updates on potential Jimmy Butler talks? You said the talks were "overstated" but is there a chance they could pick up again?</p>
</b>
<p>Wolfson: No update on Butler. Told as of two days ago that there weren't any recent talks. But we know that Thibs thinks the world of Butler and that the two teams talked, at minimum, last summer. It's logical to think the Wolves, like almost every team, would have interest in a top-10 two-way player. I just still need to be convinced that Chicago will actually trade him. I have yet to hear they actually will.</p>

<p><b>Q: Is there a sense around the league of what the Wolves could get if they deal pick seven? Or, who they will select at #7?</p> </b>

<p>Wolfson: Still digging on that one. Just keep hearing that they are open for business. But I am now up to three teams within ten-picks of the Wolves who all believe the Wolves stay at seven and take Arizona's Lauri Markkanen.</p>

<p><b>Q: Do you see Thibs and company making their first trade for the Wolves this offseason?</p>
</b>
<p>Wolfson: I do, although I always remind folks that 90 percent of trades talked about never happen.</p>

<p><b>Q: With free agency fast approaching, are there any names to keep an eye on if you're a Wolves fan?</p>
</b>
<p>Wolfson: If they move Rubio, a point guard like Holiday, Teague, Hill, etc.</p>

<p><b>Q: What's going on with the Ricky Rubio talk? He's in the rumor mill every season, is this the year he's finally dealt?</p>
</b>
<p>Wolfson: I can't sit here and predict if he gets moved or not. What I can tell you: he can be had, and if the Wolves get the right offer, he'll be moved. Teams to watch include Dallas, New Orleans, Sacramento, and New York. But if the Kings get Fox, we can probably cross them off. If New Orleans can keep Holiday, we can probably cross them off. Told that there's no match with the Knicks.</p>

<p><b>Q: With Noah Croom, Wolves assistant GM, getting an interview for the Milwaukee GM job, what does that show Wolves fans about their staff under Thibs and Layden?</p>
</b>
<p>Wolfson: Many people interviewed for the Bucks job, and Croom wasn't a finalist. That being said, Noah is highly thought of in league circles and knows the salary cap so bleepin' well. He's an asset for the Wolves.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Darren Wolfson again for taking time out of his day to answer questions.</p>
