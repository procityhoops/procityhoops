<p>53 games into the 2017-18 NBA season, the Minnesota Timberwolves sit at 32-21 and fourth in the Western Conference. While the Wolves are in good position right now, they have let some games slip by that they should have won. After a loss to the Atlanta Hawks last night, they now have losses to the Hawks, Grizzlies, Suns (two), Nets, and Magic. However, sitting at fourth in the West, the Wolves are primed for a playoff run. For what has been a great season to this point for the Wolves, let’s take a look at some interesting stats surrounding the team.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>The Minnesota Timberwolves are 20-6 at home, but they are 12-15 on the road.</b></h4>
<p>For the Wolves, winning at home has been a big part of their success so far this season, but the road struggles have prevented them from being even higher in the West. Their home/road record proves one thing for the Wolves: home-court advantage in the first round of the Western Conference Playoffs would be huge.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Jeff Teague is shooting just 34.8% from three-point range</b></h4>
<p>In the offseason, the Wolves inked Teague to a three-year deal worth $19 million a year. One big reason they signed Teague to that deal was because of his three-point shooting ability. However, Teague has not given the Wolves what they have wanted from downtown this season. His three-point percentage is the lowest it has been since the 2014-15 season, and he is also not getting to the free-throw line as much. His three free-throw attempts per game are the lowest amount of attempts per game since 2012-13 when he attempted just 2.8 free-throws per game.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>On average, the Timberwolves starters are outscoring opponents 82.8 to 67.1, but the bench is being outscored 38.8 to 26.1</b></h4>
<p>One of the biggest focal points of the offseason was to shore up the bench play after it had been in the bottom half of the league for quite some time. Unfortunately for the Wolves, adding Jamal Crawford and moving Gorgui Dieng to the bench has not completed that task. The Wolves’ starters continue to tear up the league, even the best teams in the association, but when the bench comes in, the game seems to get out of control for the Wolves. Teams in the NBA win championships by having a deep team, just ask the Warriors whose bench averaged 32.8 points per game last season.</p>
