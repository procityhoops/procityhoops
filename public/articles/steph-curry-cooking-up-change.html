<h1>Steph Curry: Cooking up Change</h1>

<p>Immortality.  Lasting impact.  To be remembered for something.  I can’t be the only one who has dreamt of such.  I think of the musicians who have changed everything like Elvis and Michael Jackson. There will never be anyone like them. I think about the stars born out of these revolutionary’s greatness who come close, but can never quite impact music and culture in the same way.  I think about Donald Trump.  I am not a fan, but the impact he has on young people and the way politics has changed will be remembered forever.  The person who is the “best” at something doesn’t necessarily leave the greatest mark.  When I think of the game of basketball there are examples of these change agents and imitators of those change agents.  I think of how the game has evolved and who has spearheaded each movement.   The NBA has another one of those “change agents” in its midst right now.  His name is Steph Curry.  Since Michael Jordan, no player has had a greater impact on the game of basketball than this man; not even the greatest player of this generation, LeBron James.</p>
<p>I want to be very clear about one thing moving forward.  In no universe do I think Curry is a better player than James, but as long as we are talking about impacting the evolution of basketball and its future then Curry is running circles around him.  James is the most complete player we have ever seen and his ability to impact a single game is unrivaled, but that is not what I’m getting at.  Let’s start with his impact off the court.  Over the summer I coached a few basketball camps for kids.  The number of 7-12-year-old kids wearing Steph jerseys every day astounded me.  They were talking about him all the time.  These kids are coming in the gym and heading straight for the three-point line.</p>
<p>Steph’s popularity has tapped into something no other stars have been able to, attainable dreams.  We marvel at players like LeBron James in part because we know we could never be like that.  Kids at a young age know they can’t look like LeBron. They can’t be as big and tall as Shaq or jump as high and be as fast as Westbrook. But when they look at the cuddly, slim, baby faced point guard in Golden State, they see something inspiring.  They see an attainable dream.</p>

<p>Curry’s 2009 draft report called his explosiveness and athleticism “below standard”, stated that he needed to “considerably improve as a ball handler”, and predicted he would have limited success at the next level.  Curry responded by putting in relentless work on his handles and footwork allowing him to become who he is today.  Kids relate to this. His coach Steve Kerr commented on Curry’s impact by saying, "They all identify with him.” He's the rare superstar where an eight-year-old kid can go, 'He looks just like me. Maybe I can do it.'"</p>
<p>Diminishing Steph’s skills are not the aim here.  The goal is to explain how Steph Curry is impacting youth (who happen to be the future of basketball) in ways no one else can because the fun-loving way he plays and how he got to this point are things kids look at and say, “I can do that”.  Will we ever see another Steph Curry? No. We won’t.   Just like Kobe is referred to as the “closest to being like MJ” we will see players come along who remind us of him, who can be about 80% of what Steph was, but a player with that skill set and impact on the game will never come again.</p>
<p>Since Steph has come into the league we have seen the number of three-point shots attempted rise each year.  Just like Michael paved the way for future stars, Steph has been the figurehead of a movement that values the three-point shot and small ball over all else.  Steph took the league by storm when he exploded onto the scene and claimed his first MVP award.  He followed it up with the greatest shooting season of all time by nailing in a seemingly impossible 400 threes and becoming the first ever unanimous MVP.  He is not a complete player by any means.  He has his flaws, but the three-point shot has changed the game dramatically, and he is at the forefront of this movement.</p>
<p>The final point to his impact is his unparalleled value to Under Armour.  A 2016 Forbes article written by Jonathon Chew estimates that Curry alone adds $14 billion to Under Armour’s market-cap value, and could even rival Michael Jordan’s worth to Nike. While Curry’s previous two shoes have underperformed in the market, his value cannot be understated.  UA was simply an apparel store who couldn’t hope to compete in shoes sales with the likes of Nike, but Steph has put them on a global map.  UA has seen astronomical growth since their partnership with Curry leading CEO Kevin Plank to say, “We’re just beginning to see what partnering with the right athlete, like Stephen Curry, can do for our business.”</p>
<p>He can’t jump the highest or run the fastest, and he isn’t the strongest, but here he is.  He is changing basketball forever and inspiring kids to lace up and believe if they work hard enough they can be like Steph.  He has NBA coaches wracking their brains trying to figure out how to neutralize and slow down the small ball monster rampaging through the league.  He has GM’s scrambling to make moves to acquire more of the precious skill of three-point shooting and versatile players to go small.  He even has a company that was once an afterthought trending upwards in shoe sales. It’s all coming from the guy you would least expect.  His name is Steph Curry.  I expect you will remember that.</p>
