<h1>Is Kevin Love being overlooked?</h1>

<p>In the 2013-14 NBA season, Kevin Love averaged 26.1 points per game and led the Minnesota Timberwolves in scoring. Since being traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers, Love hasn’t averaged more than 19 points per game in a single season. In addition to taking a dip in the statistical category, it seems like Love is always the one being blamed when things aren’t going well for Cleveland. He’s found his name in trade rumors over the past couple of seasons, and he hasn’t looked completely comfortable in the Cavs’ offense. The obvious reason for Love’s point decrease is that he’s now playing with LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, so Love doesn’t get as many touches as he’s used to. However, is Love’s value decreasing across the league? The point is, Love is just as valuable as he was in the 2013-14 season, he just needs another chance to prove it.</p>
<p>When Kevin Love was with the Minnesota Timberwolves, his best season came during the 2013-14 season when the Wolves finished the season at 40-42. Love was the main option on the Timberwolves and averaged 26.1 points, 12.5 rebounds, and 4.4 assists per game. He took 18.5 shots per game and made 45.7% of those shots. He was a force to be reckoned with, and if you were facing the Timberwolves, the first thing you thought about was how to control Kevin Love.</p>

<p>Although his numbers have decreased since he got traded to the Cavs, the fact is that his production isn’t decreasing with the number of touches and shots that he gets. In his last season with the Timberwolves, Kevin Love took 18.5 shots per game. In his first three seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers, the most shots Love has taken per game in a single season is 14.5, coming just last season. He averaged 19.0 points per game last season, but he accomplished that while just putting up 14.5 shots per game, four shots less per game than what he took in his final season in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Another reason that Love’s production has decreased in Cleveland is because of the amount of touches he gets early in the game. In Minnesota, the Timberwolves would go to Love early in the game to get him into a rhythm. Then, after he was in a rhythm, they would keep feeding Love the ball so he stayed hot. While they are still getting Love early touches in Cleveland, he can’t get into a rhythm because after the first quarter, his amount of shots go down significantly. Take last season as an example, in the first quarter of games, Kevin Love averaged 7.6 points on six shots. But, after the first quarter, Love would only take 2.8 shots in the second quarter, 4.1 shots in the third quarter, and 2.1 shots in the fourth quarter. How can a player get into a groove when they know the majority of their touches will come at the beginning of the game? The main takeaway from this is that the Cavaliers finally learned they had to get Love going early in the game, which they did, but then they forgot to keep him involved as the game went on.</p>
<p>The final reason that Kevin Love’s production has decreased while he’s the third option in Cleveland is because of his point guard: Kyrie Irving. While Irving is a tremendous point guard, one of the top in the NBA, he isn’t the most gifted at passing the ball. While Love was in Minnesota, he played with one of, if not the best, passing point guards in the NBA: Ricky Rubio. Rubio and Love had great chemistry on the floor and it seemed like Rubio always knew where Love would be at a specific time. In the 2013-14 season, Ricky Rubio had a 50.1% assist percentage. In the 2016-17 season, Kyrie Irving had a 34.2% assist percentage, that’s a 15.9% difference between the two point guards. Irving had very little to do with Love’s production and if Love could play with a pass-first point guard again, he would immediately put up better numbers.</p>
<p>In short, Kevin Love is still a very valuable player in the NBA. If he ever gets to lead a team again, there is no doubt in my mind that he would be right back into the 25 points per game range. He has been the third option on the Cavs for three years now, and he deserves more touches. Obviously, his production could go way up even this next season if Cleveland decides to move on from Kyrie Irving, but Kevin Love is a player that the Cavs need to value because he’s still an all-star caliber player.</p>
