<h1>Karl-Anthony Towns: Season Review</h1>
<p>Last Thursday, the NBA announced the All-NBA first, second, and third teams. One name that was missing from all three of the lists? Karl-Anthony Towns. To say the least, Towns was quite shocked with the results.</p>

<p>Towns was the 2016 NBA Rookie of the Year and in his sophomore season, he did nothing but impress.</p>
<br>
<p>Coming into the season, the Minnesota Timberwolves hired Tom Thibodeau to be their new head coach. Just like any new incoming coach, it took time for the Timberwolves and Towns to adjust to Thibs. Early in the season, the Timberwolves were losing games night in and night out. More surprisingly, Towns was having trouble putting up the numbers that everyone anticipated coming into the season. Towns was shooting more threes than his rookie year and was not hitting as many as he needed to. Through the first two months of the season, Towns had averaged just 22 points per game. This is by no means a bad number, but Towns was not playing his game. In November and December, Towns was heaving up 3.7 threes per game. He hit on just 32.2% of those threes and he was not taking as many inside shots as he needed to. In his rookie season, Towns did the majority of his work on offense in the post and at the elbow, which proved to be very effective. So, in January, and through the rest of the season, Towns went back to what he knew best: the post.</p>
<br>
<p>In January, Towns averaged 25.4 points per game and shot just 2.9 threes per game. After January, Towns went on to average 28.3 points per game through the rest of the season. Towns capitalized off of Ricky Rubio’s terrific passing and he became the first player in NBA history to record 2,000 points, 1,000 rebounds, and 100 three pointers in a single season. His final season totals came out to 25.1 points per game and 12.3 rebounds per game. And yes, Towns is just 21 years old.</p>
<br>
<p>The next part of Towns’ game that continued to grow this season was his leadership. In his rookie season, Towns always talked about how much he wanted to be the leader of the Timberwolves on and off the court. In his second season in the NBA, fans around the league could see that taking shape. Multiple times throughout the season Towns would post photos on social media of himself putting in work in the gym or the weight room in the following hours after a loss. The example below is after the Wolves came up short against the high-powered Houston Rockets.</p>

<p>Most players go to practice, compete in the games and that is it. Towns has shown that he is not content with being average. So far in his career, Towns seems motivated to get the Wolves back to the playoffs and at this point, who can doubt him?</p>
<br>
<p>Although Towns had a very impressive sophomore season, there are still many ways for him to put himself into the conversation as a potential top-five player in the NBA. Towns is not up-to-par on the defensive end yet. He is often caught out of position or not being able to handle a physical big man. Obviously, Towns is only 21 years old and as he grows physically, he will be able to handle some of the more physical centers in the game. Coach Thibodeau will also continue to show Towns the ropes on the defensive side of the ball. Another part of Towns’ game that he will need to improve is his three-point shooting. If Towns can continue to develop his three-point shot, he will become virtually impossible to stop. Towns did shoot 36.7% from three-point range this season, but he caught fire from downtown late in the season, which skyrocketed his numbers. If Towns has hopes of becoming an MVP candidate for years to come, he will need both a post game and an outside game to keep defenders on their toes.</p>
<br>
<p>If not one already, Karl-Anthony Towns is a star in the making. He was snubbed from All-NBA honors this season, but for Towns it will just add fuel to the fire. Towns had a terrific season for Minnesota and if he continues to improve, the Timberwolves will be back in the postseason very soon.</p>
