<h1>The Last Straw</h1>
<p>On Sunday afternoon the 2017 NBA Playoffs will experience their first Game 7 of the year. The Clippers and Jazz face off on Sunday afternoon in their biggest game of the season. For NBA fans, this game adds to an already exciting first round of the NBA Playoffs.</p>
<br>
<p>In the history of the NBA there has been 126 Game 7’s with number 127 coming on Sunday afternoon. In the history of Game 7’s there has been heroes, game winners, and many heartbreaks.</p>
<br>
<p>Who can forget about the 2008 Eastern Conference Semifinals when Lebron James and Paul Pierce went back and forth in Game 7? Lebron James had 45 points and Paul Pierce had 41, but it was P.J. Brown who hit a short jumper that allowed the Celtics to pull away from the Cavaliers and send them home packing.</p>
<br>
<p>How about the 1981 Eastern Conference Finals? The Celtics were down in the series 3-1 only to come all the way back to defeat the 76ers in a historic Game 7. Larry Bird put up 23 points, 11 rebounds, and 5 assists as the Celtics rallied from down 89-82 in the fourth quarter.</p>
<br>
<p>And the 1988 NBA Finals? The Lakers were playing their third Game 7 of their playoffs, when Finals MVP, James Worthy, went crazy and posted 36 points and 16 rebounds leading the Lakers to an NBA Championship repeat.</p>
<br>
<p>Then there was the Spurs and Clippers first round series in 2015 that saw Chris Paul hit an acrobatic game winner at the buzzer to send Tim Duncan and the Spurs home packing. Earlier in that game nobody would’ve suspected Chris Paul to be the hero. In the first quarter he left with a hamstring injury and it looked like it would be hard for him to return. But, against all odds he nailed the game winner practically with one good leg.</p>
<br>
<p>And then there were the 2016 NBA Finals, arguably the best Game 7 in NBA history. The Warriors were leading the Cavaliers 3-1 in the series and it looked like they were on their way to being back-to-back NBA Champions. But, Lebron James and the Cavaliers fought their way back into the series and forced a Game 7 at Oracle Arena in Oakland. Then, there was a Game 7 that nobody will ever forget. With a one minute and fifty-four seconds left in the fourth quarter, the game was tied at 89. Then came “The Block” and “The Shot”. Lebron James came out of nowhere and denied Andre Iguodala of an easy two. Then, one minute later, Kyrie Irving sank the go ahead three pointer that put the Cavaliers up for good. This game brought the entire NBA family together as everybody watched in awe on the most important night in the NBA.</p>
<br>
<p>As the Clippers and Jazz are set to kick off the first Game 7 of the 2017 NBA Playoffs, this is a reminder that heroes and classics are made in Game 7’s.</p>
