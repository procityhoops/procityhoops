<p>The Milwaukee Bucks finished the 2016-2017 NBA season with a record of 42-40, good enough for the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference. After a valiant effort, Milwaukee was bounced from the first round by the Toronto Raptors in six games. Led by the league’s most improved player, Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Bucks have a bright future once Jabari Parker returns from injury next season. Had Parker not been injured last season, it’s possible the Bucks could have matched up with Cleveland in the second round of the Eastern Conference Playoffs instead of Toronto. The Bucks had the 17th pick in the draft last week and chose to add D.J Wilson, a stretch 4 from the University of Michigan. Wilson will add to the Bucks already amazing length. Now, the Bucks will look to further improve their roster in hopes of making a deeper playoff run next season.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Max Cap Space: -$8 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: Tony Snell<br>
Unrestricted: Jason Terry, Michael Beasley</p>
<p>The Bucks are going to be performing some cap space Olympics this offseason. Retaining Tony Snell has become a priority for the team after his productive regular season and remarkable playoff series showdown with DeMar DeRozan. Snell should have plenty of suitors this offseason as a three and D who shot almost 40% from deep this past season.</p>
<p>Jason Terry provided a veteran spark off the bench this past season and could re-sign for the right number. In addition to Terry, Beasley may be willing to re-sign on the cheap, which is something Milwaukee should pounce on. With that being said, both Terry and Beasley are replaceable if their cap numbers become too high.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Andre Iguodala, Tony Allen</p>
<p>While the Bucks do not have many needs outside of growth from young talent and getting healthy, they could benefit from adding more defensive prowess this offseason. Iguodala would give them veteran leadership and experience which could be invaluable to not only Giannis but Khris Middleton and Jabari Parker too. Allen, who is virtually invisible on offense, would provide the same defensive intensity and could help turn the Bucks into one of the best defensive teams in the league. </p>
