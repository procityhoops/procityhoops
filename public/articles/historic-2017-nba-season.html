<h1>The Historic Upcoming 2017-18 NBA Season</h1>

<p>The NBA offseason is usually one of rest and relaxation for most. Between the difficult grind day in and day out, and the lengthy season, players usually use the end of April to mid-August to spend time with family, travel, or pick up new hobbies. However, this off season in particular has seen the most shake ups in regard to new teams and new faces. But the real question at hand, is are all of these trades, signings, and releases setting us up for must see television come October 17th?</p>
<p>For starters, the summer really started when the Boston Celtics announced that they would be swapping picks with the Philadelphia 76ers, thus leaving them with the number three pick, while Philly claimed the heralded number one pick. The Boston Celtics looked poised to select University of Washington standout Markelle Fultz with the number one overall pick, however Celtics General Manager Danny Ainge was quoted saying, “it was our intention to take Jayson Tatum all along, regardless of pick.” Tatum received heavy comparisons to Paul Pierce and even Knicks Forward Carmelo Anthony, as he is highly considered the best offensive player in this year’s draft.</p>
<p>On the night of the draft, the Chicago Bulls shocked the world by trading all-star guard Jimmy Butler, and newly drafted Creighton center Justin Patton to the Minnesota Timberwolves, in exchange for two-time slam dunk champion, Zach LaVine, guard Kris Dunn, and rookie forward Lauri Markkanen. This comes at a time when Chicago did not live up to expectations with the addition of veteran guard Dwyane Wade, and Minnesota is blossoming into a threat in the Western Conference, with solid players such as Karl-Anthony Towns, Jeff Teague, and Andrew Wiggins. Many fully expect Minnesota to make a statement in the West this year, and with a very young lineup (the average age of the team is only 26 years old), they have the ability to really compete with powerhouse teams such as San Antonio, Houston, and of course, Golden State.</p>

<p>Shortly after the 2017 NBA Draft, the Houston Rockets decided to help out MVP candidate James Harden, by trading for superstar guard Chris Paul from the Los Angeles Clippers. With the addition of Paul, and the ever-looming possibility that Carmelo Anthony could be joining them before the season starts, Houston will look to continue to assert their dominance in a tough conference for years to come.</p>
<p>Another team that decided to help out their MVP was the Oklahoma City Thunder, by trading for Indiana Pacers forward Paul George. George has been a consistent threat for teams in the Eastern Conference, averaging just over 18 points per game in his seven-year career. George has the ability to provide another scoring option for triple-double machine Russell Westbrook, while also being a solid defender to prevent any opposing player from exposing the small forward position. In return, all the Thunder had to give up was shooting guard Victor Oladipo, as well as second-year forward Domantas Sabonis.</p> 
<p>Finally, to end the summer madness, the Boston Celtics and the Cleveland Cavaliers pulled off one of the most blockbuster trades the league has ever seen. After the Celtics picked up free agent forward Gordon Hayward from the Utah Jazz, and with Cleveland re-signing sharp shooter Kyle Korver, as well as the addition of former MVP Derrick Rose, both teams were in a great position to start the season. However, in a trade that shocked the basketball world, Cleveland guard Kyrie Irving was traded to the Celtics for budding start Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, rookie forward, Ante Zizic, as well as the Brooklyn Nets 2018 1st round pick and the Houston Rockets 2020 2nd round pick.</p>
<p>So, what does all of this mean for this 2017-2018 season? Simply put, this will be one of the better seasons we have seen in a long time… And I know that sounds impossible, but the storylines are too good to be true. With so many new players in new destinations, there is a recipe for some solid basketball every single night. So that being said, here are some final predictions for the season, based on how things have shaken out thus far.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Rookie of the Year: Jayson Tatum (Boston Celtics)</b></h4>
<p>Tatum is coming off of a stellar season with Duke, averaging nearly 17 points and 8 rebounds per game for the Blue Devils. Tatum joins a Celtics team that finished first in the Eastern Conference, and with the addition of another Duke star (Irving), Tatum has the ability to come into a solid system with Brad Stevens leading the way, and be a contributing member of an already stacked roster. Look for Tatum to slide his way into the starting lineup from time to time as the season progresses, as he has huge upside potential in terms of scoring ability and basketball IQ.</p> 
<br>
<h4><b>Defensive Player of the Year: Kawhi Leonard (San Antonio Spurs)</b></h4>
<p>Kawhi Leonard should be a three-time DPOY award winner already, however Golden State Warriors Forward Draymond Green captured last year’s nomination. Leonard has constantly been a matchup nightmare for opposing teams, as his wingspan is over seven feet, while his hands alone are nearly 10 inches long. Kawhi has averaged close to two steals per game in his six-year career, while tallying a block per game as well. But many of his stats do not show up in the box score, as he alters, deflects, and changes shots, passes, and dribbles for his opponent. Many fully expect him to continue frazzling other players, while he claims another DPOY award to add to an already impressive NBA career. </p>
<br>
<h4><b>MVP: James Harden (Houston Rockets)</b></h4>
<p>Last year’s MVP award rightfully went to Russell Westbrook, but that does not mean that James Harden should have been out of the question. Harden is coming off of one of the best seasons of his career, averaging 29 points, 11 assists, and 8 rebounds per game. With the addition of Chris Paul to take a majority of the load off in terms of ball handling, look for Harden to really increase scoring, and take his team deep into the playoffs once again. </p>
<br>
<h4><b>NBA Champion: Golden State Warriors</b></h4>
<p>It is very tough to compete with a team that has four all-stars all in their prime on the same team. That being said, the only way the Warriors do not win a championship is due to injury to one of these four players (Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green). They wiped last season clean all the way to the Finals, and they also showed no signs of weakness throughout the process. It is tough to bet against Golden State, but until another team can put together enough pieces to stop the bleeding, the Warriors will continue to hoist the trophy in June.</p>
