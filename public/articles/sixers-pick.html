<h1>What should the Sixers do with the third pick?</h1>

<p>Trust the process took on an entirely new meaning this season with the much anticipated debut of Joel Embiid. Embiid, the former #3 pick in the 2014 draft, has battled injuries throughout his young career. Although he eventually fell victim to another lower body injury, he averaged 20 points, 8 rebounds, and nearly 3 blocks per game in 31 games this past season.</p>
<p>In addition to the rise of Embiid, Philadelphia won 28 games and showed many reasons for optimism moving forward. Ben Simmons, the 2016 NBA Draft’s #1 pick, will make his long anticipated debut next season and the team will hope that Dario Saric takes another step forward during his sophomore campaign. Add to that the potential of Robert Covington and Jahlil Okafor, and the Sixers look poised to improve on their success this season.</p>
<p>Philadelphia is in desperate need of guard play this offseason and will receive reinforcements with Simmons projecting to play point forward and the potential addition of either Malik Monk, De’Aaron Fox or Dennis Smith Jr. Add to that their ability to potentially offer a max contract to a player like Kyle Lowry, or a healthy offer to Patty Mills, and they should be able to improve their backcourt in free agency.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>The Pick: Josh Jackson, Forward, Kansas.</b></h4>
<p>Josh Jackson possesses scary two-way potential and would be an example of best player available at this point in the draft. While Philly has depth in its frontcourt, no player on their current roster offers the potential that Jackson does in this draft. Can you imagine the athleticism and length in a lineup that includes Simmons, Jackson, Covington, Saric, and Embiid?</p>
<p>While Fox, Monk, or Smith would provide Philly with a player at a position of need, the potential of adding a player like Jackson will be too much to pass up. Philadelphia is still years away from contention so they can afford to push off their guard need for one more season. Fox’s game, and lack of a jumper, would not fit well with the 76ers and Monk is not worthy of the #3 pick as an undersized shooting guard. Smith offers intriguing potential, but his upside does not match that of Jackson’s.</p>
<p>Giving Ben Simmons one year to prove himself as a point forward, Philly will gladly cash in on Jackson and his potential.</p>
