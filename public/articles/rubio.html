<h1>Ricky Rubio on the move?</h1>
<p>Ricky Rubio recently hired a new agent, Jeff Schwartz. Ever since the Timberwolves dealt Kevin Love to the Cavaliers, Rubio's name has been in trade rumors. Some of the top names in the NBA (Woj, Stein), have reported that Rubio would likely be on the move, but so far, it has not happened. Rubio has previously been vocal about the Timberwolves' struggles and has stated his desire to be on a winning team. On Darren Wolfson's latest "The Scoop" podcast, Wolfson stated that a source close to Rubio told him, "Ricky Rubio chose Schwartz because he would get him out of Minnesota ASAP. That was the only criteria acceptable for a new agent."<br><br> A couple teams to keep an eye on if the Wolves decide to deal Rubio are the Spurs, Knicks, and Kings. Obviously, this does not mean that a trade will happen, but it is something to keep an eye on in the summer of 2017.</p>
