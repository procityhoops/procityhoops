<h1>Jimmy Butler: MVP Candidate</h1>

<p>The Minnesota Timberwolves are currently sitting at fourth in the Western Conference with a record of 22-13, their best record at this point in the season in over a decade. The biggest reason the Wolves are where they are? Two words, one name: Jimmy Butler. The Wolves acquired Butler from the Bulls this offseason, and Minnesota fans have not been disappointed. Butler is averaging 21.2 points per game this season, 20th in the NBA. In addition, Butler is also averaging 5.5 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game. Yes, those numbers are impressive, but what is even more impressive is what Butler has done in the month of December. This month, Butler is averaging a clean 27 PPG, 5.5 RPG, and 5.2 APG. Butler started the season off slow in terms of scoring the basketball, but it seems like he has certainly found his groove in the month of December.</p>

<p>While his offensive firepower has certainly helped the Wolves this season, his defensive skills and his killer mentality have also played a big role in why the Wolves currently sit at 22-13. The Timberwolves have not had an “F you” type player since Kevin Garnett. Butler is just that and more. Butler cares about one thing and one thing only: winning, a satisfying sight for Wolves’ fans. Likewise, Butler is carrying the Wolves on the defensive end. The Timberwolves currently sit at 25th in the league in defensive rating (108.0). However, if not for Jimmy Butler and Taj Gibson, the Wolves would almost certainly be last in that category. It seems as if Butler and Gibson are the only players that always seem to be in the right position on defense. Yes, they are veterans in the NBA, and yes they have played in Thibodeau’s system before, but to give 100% effort on the defensive end night in and night out is impressive.</p>

<p>So, with everything considered, Jimmy Butler was possibly the best offseason acquisition in the entire NBA last summer, but why has he not been in the conversation for the NBA’s Most Valuable Player? The simple answer is national attention. Although the Wolves are improved this season, they still do not get anywhere near the attention that top-tier teams like the Warriors, Rockets, and Cavaliers do. Another possible reason is Butler’s slow start scoring the ball early in the season. Butler started off the first 12 games of the season averaging under 15 points per game, well below MVP-caliber numbers. But, as previously noted, Butler has been on a tear recently and needs to be seriously considered in the MVP conversation.</p>

<p>Butler is averaging his MVP-type numbers in December, but he is doing everything else that an MVP player should as well. He is being a leader on and off the court, he is putting forth the effort on defense, and most importantly, he is helping the Timberwolves win games, something they have not done in over a decade. Butler may not be a noticeable MVP candidate to the national media, but taking a team that was 13th in the West last season, to currently fourth in the West should be praised nonetheless.</p>
