<h1>Oklahoma City Thunder Free Agency Preview</h1>

<p>The Oklahoma City Thunder finished the 2016-2017 NBA season with a record of 47-35, good enough for the sixth seed in the Western Conference. After a valiant effort, Oklahoma City was bounced from the first round by the Houston Rockets in five games. Led by the league’s most valuable player, Russell Westbrook, the Thunder feature one of the most dynamic backcourts in the league.  While Victor Oladipo struggled to find his shot this past season, he was a good counterpart to Westbrook and allowed Russell the ability to run the offense to the best of his ability. Andre Roberson also took an immense step forward this past season. Roberson was also able to take the pressure off of Westbrook on the defensive end by guarding the opposing team's best offensive wing option. The Thunder’s management will now focus on improving the talent around Westbrook and the Thunder’s core in order to make a deeper run in the postseason next year.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Max Cap Space: -$13 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: Andre Roberson, Jerami Grant<br>
Unrestricted: Taj Gibson, Nick Collison, and Norris Cole</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, Andre Roberson took a major step forward this past season as a defender and became a regular replacing Kevin Durant in the starting five. While Roberson’s game on offense is still a major work in progress, he is an All-NBA defender which allows Westbrook the freedom to be at his best and gamble on defense. Gibson was traded for at the deadline in addition to Doug McDermott. Gibson provided solid veteran leadership and defensive ability after he was acquired. While OKC would love to retain Gibson, he may have plenty of suitors in the marketplace, and the Thunder may decide the price is too high. As for Jerami Grant, the Thunder have the choice whether or not to pick up his $1.5 million contract for next season. It would be smart for the team to pick up the option since Grant is still young and improving.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Danilo Gallinari, JaMychal Green</p>
<p>While OKC may be priced out for both Green and Gallinari’s range after signing Roberson, both would become ideal fits for Oklahoma City. While Roberson has become a vital piece to the Thunder defense, Gallinari would be able to offer an offensive prowess that Roberson will never be capable of. JaMychal Green would also be an ideal fit next to Steven Adams if they choose to let Taj Gibson walk. Green’s still young enough to grow with the team and has the ability to become a successful stretch four this season and beyond.  </p>
