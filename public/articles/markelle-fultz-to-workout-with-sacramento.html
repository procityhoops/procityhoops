<p>Early this morning, Ailene Voisin of the Sacramento Bee reported that Markelle Fultz will be working out for the Sacramento Kings on Sunday, June 11th. Fultz is the consensus #1 pick, and there is absolutely zero chance he drops to #5 where the Kings pick. However, the Kings also have the #10 pick, and there has been some buzz that they are trying to move up. It would likely take more than the fifth and tenth pick to pry the first overall selection from Boston, but the fact that Fultz would even workout for the Kings tells fans that a trade up is very possible.</p>
