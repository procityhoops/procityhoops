<p>In what ended up being a disappointing matchup of two very different teams, Lonzo Ball and Markelle Fultz both put up impressive numbers. Saturday was an action packed day for college basketball fans with six top ten ranked teams losing to teams ranked lower than them or even unranked. NBA fans had to wait until late into the night to see what was one of the most intriguing story lines of the day.</p>
<br>
<p>Two teams in far different places matched up in Washington, as UCLA and its national championship contending roster traveled to Washington to take on a Washington team that will most likely miss out on the NCAA tournament. The game itself was not what brought fans in as it was nearly a foregone conclusion that UCLA would dominate despite being on the road. What made the game interesting was the storyline of two players who are almost guaranteed to be the top two picks in this coming summer’s NBA draft. Both Lonzo Ball and Markelle Fultz are elite level point guards with the potential to turn a franchise around.</p>
<br>
<p>Lonzo Ball is one of college basketball’s most charismatic stars. His story has been well known for a few years as he won a high school national championship last year for Chino Hills in California with his two younger brothers, LiAngelo and Lamelo. There were questions about whether or not Ball would fit into a NBA system. In high school, Ball played in an offense similar to the seven second offense that the Phoenix Suns ran in the mid 2000s. Ball has proven this year with UCLA that a fast paced offense can win games as UCLA has gone from a sub .500 team to being 21-3 and ranked 11th in the country.</p>
<br>​
<p>As an overall player, Ball is a generational talent with elite vision as a passer. On several occasions last night Ball attacked the basket only to find one of his big men for a perfectly placed lob. One of the more unique parts of Ball’s game is his shooting ability. Ball has a very unique shot with an odd form that scouts have wanted him to change for a long time. His mechanics appear to be that of someone just learning to shoot but it has worked for him consistently as he continues to be one of the best long range shooters in college basketball. He also has the speed and athleticism that is difficult to find in young players. Ball is a highlight reel waiting to be made.</p>
<br>
<p>On the other side of the court on Saturday was the struggling Washington team with a lone bright spot in Markelle Fultz. Fultz isn’t as big of a celebrity as Lonzo Ball, but that doesn’t mean that he’s any less of a player than Ball is. Fultz is an amazingly well rounded player with the ability to hit pull-up threes or pull down offensive rebounds and finish as he did Saturday night. One of the reasons Fultz isn’t as big of a celebrity as Ball is because he didn’t start playing in varsity games until he was a junior in high school. He had a meteoric rise throughout his last two seasons in high school at Dematha Catholic in Maryland. Fultz ended up making the McDonald’s All American Game last year, which was the only other time that he and Ball have squared off against each other.</p>
<br>
<p>On Saturday night, Fultz showed why many think he should be the first overall pick in this coming NBA draft. He hit a couple quick threes while getting around double teams. One of the best sequences in the game happened about three minutes into the second half when Fultz hit a step back three. This sparked Lonzo Ball to pull up from a few feet behind the line on UCLA’s next possession. Fultz then proceeded thirty seconds later to hit another step back three with Ball in his face. Fultz was also able to showcase his athleticism quick bursts to get open despite being double teamed most of the game.</p>
<br>
<p>At the end of the game, UCLA won easily as expected, but both Lonzo Ball and Markelle Fultz put up big numbers. If I were an NBA executive with the top pick in the NBA draft, I would be having plenty of sleepless nights trying to figure out which of these two players would fit my franchise better. At the end of the day, I believe Lonzo Ball is the better option for two reasons: his swagger and his winning mentality. Ball brings a swagger to his game that most players don’t ever have and he has the confidence in his game at just 19 years old that some NBA players in their prime don’t have. He also has a winner’s mentality having gone undefeated in his senior year of high school and is now shaping UCLA into a national championship contender. Fultz will undoubtedly be an NBA star for many years, but Ball has the personality to be a title contender for his entire career.</p>
