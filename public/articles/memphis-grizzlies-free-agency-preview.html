<p>The Memphis Grizzlies finished last season with a record of 43-39. The Grizzlies had a down year compared to other years, and they were knocked off by San Antonio in the first round of the Western Conference Playoffs. The Grizzlies were led by Mike Conley who averaged 20.5 points and 6.3 assists per game last season. The Grizzlies also got production from Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol who combined for 33.6 points and 14.5 rebounds per game. The Grizzlies will need to find a way to improve this offseason while some big names hit the free agent market.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $5 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted:  JaMychal Green, Wayne Selden<br>
Unrestricted: Tony Allen, Vince Carter, and Zach Randolph</p>
<p>The Memphis Grizzlies have some big decisions to make with their own free agents this offseason. The Grizzlies can pick up the team option on Wayne Selden for next season, but at this point, it’s on which way they will go. The Grizzlies should try to re-sign JaMychal Green. Green is a stretch four that is still young, and he is very good on the defensive side of the ball. However, the main priority for the Grizzlies with their own guys will be their unrestricted free agents. Each of their three unrestricted free agents plays an important role on the team. Tony Allen is one of the best defenders in basketball, and he would be a big loss for any team. Vince Carter and Zach Randolph are still solid role players even though they are getting towards the end of their career. If the Grizzlies want to be back in the playoffs next season, they will need to re-sign their unrestricted free agents.</p>

<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>PJ Tucker, Kelly Olynyk</p>
<p>The Memphis Grizzlies are sitting in an interesting position. The Grizzlies aren’t a great team, and they won’t be competing with Golden State anytime soon. However, with the players on their team, they still need to try and win games. PJ Tucker and Kelly Olynyk would provide great depth off the bench for Memphis. Tucker would give the team a solid small forward that plays with a Grizzlies’ type of toughness. Kelly Olynyk would also provide a solid bench option. Olynyk could stretch and space the floor off the bench, and he has the potential to progress into an NBA starter.</p>
