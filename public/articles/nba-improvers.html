<p>With the regular season winding down and the playoff race heating up, the NBA is at peak entertainment. The playoffs are the best part of every NBA season with the energy creating beautiful moments in basketball history. Not every team makes the playoffs obviously, several NBA teams are not doing so hot. These teams are not the focus of NBA fans right now, but they should at least be in the back of their minds. The talent pool in the league is so deep and will only get deeper with some solid players in upcoming draft classes. In this article, I’ll be looking at some of the teams, not in the thick of the playoff race this year, but possibly could be in the coming years.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Chicago Bulls</b></h4>
<p>The Chicago Bulls blew it all up this offseason trading star player Jimmy Butler to the Minnesota Timberwolves. In return, they received Zach LaVine and Kris Dunn, both players have played well at times this year. LaVine returned from his ACL injury after the all-star break and showed some promise. Dunn played decent enough as well. The future of this team hinges majorly on the continued development of rookie Lauri Markkanen, who the Bulls also received in the Butler trade. Markkanen has looked impressive this season averaging a respectable 15 points and 7.5 rebounds per game. If they can add another solid wing in the upcoming draft, the Bulls will improve sooner rather than later.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Phoenix Suns</b></h4>
<p>Phoenix is a team I personally expected to perform better this year, but this has not happened. The roster has just not developed to this point. Players like Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss have not improved the way they should have. However, they have good players like Elfrid Payton who they traded for, T.J. Warren, and rookie Josh Jackson. The future success of this team hinges solely on one player, budding star Devin Booker. Booker is an elite scorer but has yet to develop the leadership skills needed from a team’s best player. If he can grow into that role and the Suns use this top pick wisely (Deandre Ayton anybody?), they can be in the thick of the playoff race very soon.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>New York Knicks</b></h4>
<p>The Knicks would be a playoff team if not for the unfortunate injury Kristaps Porzingis suffered. The team was playing well with an inside-out formula, led by Enes Kanter and the unicorn. Since then it has been back to the doldrums for the Knickerbockers. Tim Hardaway Jr. is a decent player but he had trouble staying on the court this year. Rookie Frank Nitilikina has been good defensively and has plenty of room for improvement on the other end. This team has the best chance to go to the playoffs next year simply because they have a star player. Hopefully, KP can get healthy and return the Knicks to the promise land.</p>
