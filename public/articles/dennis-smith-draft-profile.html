<p>Dennis Smith Jr. is one of the more intriguing prospects in the 2017 NBA Draft for a couple reasons. The first is that, similar to Markelle Fultz of Washington, he excelled on a team that failed to make the NCAA Tournament. The second is that he doesn't get as much attention off the court as other players in the draft, such as Lonzo Ball or Josh Jackson. This may lead people to think that he doesn't have the personality to be a star in the NBA, but his lack of hype doesn't mean he isn't ready to be a star in the league. Playing for North Carolina State this past season, Smith averaged 18.1 points per game, 4.6 rebounds per game, and 6.2 assists per game in 34.8 minutes per game. Entering the year there were questions about how a torn ACL in August of his senior year of high school would affect his playing ability, but Smith showed that it didn't matter. He put up very impressive numbers individually in his freshman year, but NC State never looked like a team that could consistently compete with the top teams in the ACC. The Wolfpack entered ACC play with an 11-2 record, but zero wins against power conference teams. The season went downhill from there as the team never meshed well and finished the season with a 15-17 record. Smith had two triple-doubles this past season with one of them coming against a ranked Virginia Tech team where he recorded 27 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists. His most notable performance on a national stage happened in a win at Cameron Indoor Stadium against Duke when he scored 32 points on 10-18 shooting. Smith showed he had some swagger in his game with a steal to seal the game followed by a sprint down the court after the buzzer to throw down a vicious dunk in front of the Duke band. Most mock drafts have Smith going anywhere from pick #6 to #10.</p>

<h4><b>Strengths</b></h4>
<p>Dennis Smith Jr. is the most explosive player in this year’s draft. On many occasions this year, he showed explosiveness similar to Russell Westbrook on his drives to the basket. He shows no fear in his game and is comfortable taking contact at the rim in order to get to the free throw line. He has decent size for an NBA point guard at 6’2” and about 195 pounds although he looks much stronger than 195 pounds. His strength also allows him to have one of the quickest first steps of any player in college basketball. Defenders struggled to stay with Smith on drives because his first step was so quick. However, if defenders give him any space, he is a good enough shooter to be able to knock down outside jump shots off the dribble and off the catch. He shot 35.9% from three-point range in college which should help him as a point guard in the NBA. He is not a true point guard like John Stockton, but he definitely has the playmaking ability offensively to make his teammates look better. At NC State, Smith didn't have very good outside shooters around him, but he was still able to average over 6 assists per game because of his ability to create space and make fancy passes.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Weaknesses</b></h4>
<p>Despite his freakish athleticism and overall playmaking ability, nobody is a perfect player. Dennis Smith Jr. has several flaws in his game he will need to fix before being able to put himself in the same category as Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, and James Harden as one of the best point guards in the league. His biggest weakness right now is his leadership and general attitude toward his team. There were times at North Carolina State that he looked less interested in winning and more interested in making highlight reel plays. If he is drafted to a team with a proven coach he should be able to turn into a better leader. In terms of attitude, Smith didn't always show the focus on defense that elite players have. In order to win a championship at the higher level, all five players on the court need to have a commitment to defense and Smith doesn't have that. He appeared lazy and would often stand around the perimeter away from his man just waiting for his team to get the ball back. Smith’s weaknesses will need to be worked on as soon as he enters the league if he wants to come close to reaching the potential his athleticism gives him.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>NBA Comparison</b></h4>
<p>Steve Francis. In the early 2000s, Francis was one of the most exciting point guards in the NBA. Francis showed a very similar ability to Dennis Smith Jr. being able to attack the basket with powerful finishes. Both players also have impressive ball handling abilities that allow them to create their own shots. If Smith puts up individual numbers similar to Francis, he certainly would not be considered a bust. However, Francis only made the playoffs one season in his nine-year career that was cut short by injuries. Dennis Smith Jr. will certainly want to have a more lasting impact on the league than Francis did.</p>
