<p>In recent years, the NBA has been taken over by what fans are calling “Super Teams.” In the summer of 2010, LeBron James left his hometown Cavaliers to team up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh to form a superteam in Miami. While the “Big three” were together in Miami, they made the Finals four times and won twice. Now, other players are starting to form superteams for the best shot at winning it all. The most recent example saw Kevin Durant join the Golden State Warriors who set an NBA regular season record for most wins in the 2015-2016 season. Durant joined the Warriors the summer after being defeated by them in the Western Conference Finals. Now, the Warriors are undefeated in the playoffs and own a 2-0 lead in the 2017 NBA Finals against LeBron and the Cavs. So, how can the NBA end superteams?</p>
<br>
<p>With the salary cap continuing to grow, players are earning more money than ever. Fans are seeing bench players earn up to $15 million a season, but more importantly, fans are seeing only a couple of teams being in contention each season. A simple solution to fixing superteams and making the league even is eliminating max-contracts.</p>
<p>Eliminating max-contracts would allow each team to obtain at least one or two stars. If the NBA set a specific cap number that no team could go over, but the team could offer as much money to any player that they wanted, the league would become fair. No matter how much they say it, the star players in the NBA are most interested in money. A team could theoretically offer LeBron James $60 million a season, but then they will have less money to spend on their other players. The NBA teams would get into bidding wars over players, and once they lose one guy, they would go on to the next guy. NBA stars would split up and go to different teams based on how much money a specific team is offering them.</p>
<p>While eliminating the max-contract will likely never happen, this proposal would make the NBA fair again.</p>
