<h1>The many opinions on Thibs</h1>

<p>When Tom Thibodeau was hired to be the new head coach and President of Basketball Operations for the Minnesota Timberwolves, almost every Wolves fan was on board. Now, just under two years since he was hired, a lot of Wolves fans are clamoring for Thibs to be fired. Obviously, Thibs will not be going anywhere. The man in charge for the Wolves still has three years left on his contract after this season and is due $24 million. Glen Taylor isn’t going to fork over that money to get rid of his head coach. While many Wolves fans are begging for Thibs to get out of Minnesota, I’m on the other side, I think coach Thibs is the right man for the job at this point.</p>

<p>In this article, I’m going to focus on Thibodeau as a coach and not as the President of Basketball Operations. Thibs led the Wolves to a 31-51 season last year, a disappointing season to say the least. However, although most people believed the Wolves underperformed, they were willing to give Thibs a break because it was his first season with all new players. Now, this season, the Wolves currently sit in eighth in the Western Conference with 45 wins, and this season fans are calling for his head? What makes sense about that? This Thibs-coached team is in the mix for the franchise’s first playoff berth since 2004. Yes, there is still a chance that the Wolves miss the playoffs, but when the Wolves, who played 17 games without Jimmy Butler since the all-star break, control their own destiny for a playoff spot, I’m going to give Thibs some credit.</p>

<p>Had Jimmy Butler not gotten hurt, the Wolves would likely be sitting third or fourth in the Western Conference today. When the Wolves were sitting that high in the West, not many people were complaining about Thibs. But, since Jimmy did get hurt, and the Wolves slipped, now everyone wants the man out of town. Below I’m going to break down some of the most common complaints about Tom Thibodeau.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h4><b>Complaint One: He doesn’t play the bench enough and overworks the starters</b></h4>
<p>This has been a common theme for Wolves fans for each season that Thibs has been our coach, but what did you expect? Thibs had a history of playing his starters in Chicago a lot of minutes, so why would that change in Minnesota? In the NBA, a team’s best players are going to play a lot of minutes. Butler, Wiggins, and Towns are all averaging over 35 minutes per game, so everyone thinks Thibs is overworking the starters. Now, let's check out how many minutes other star players around the league are playing. LeBron James, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Damian Lillard, and Anthony Davis are all playing over 35 minutes a night, and those aren’t the only guys. There are currently 15 guys in the league that are playing that many minutes a night, but because the three best Timberwolves’ players are among that group, fans complain. In the NBA, the best players play the most minutes, that’s just how it goes. Unless teams are super deep, which the Wolves aren’t, your top players are going to play big minutes.</p>

<p>Another reason I don’t understand the complaint about the minutes is the bench play. The Timberwolves bench is not strong, and that is putting it lightly. The top scorer off the bench is Jamal Crawford, who’s averaging 10.5 points per game, but he’s a liability on the defensive end of the court. Crawford, when he plays well, gets to play a solid amount of minutes. So, it’s not like a bench player gets pulled when they are playing a great game. The bench players get pulled early because other teams go on big runs when the Wolves have their bench guys on the floor. So the fact of the matter is, if the Wolves want to have the starters play less minutes, they need guys off the bench who can consistently give the team good minutes and not lose a lead.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Complaint Two: Thibs hasn’t improved the Wolves’ defense</b></h4>
<p>When Thibs came to Minnesota, he was known as a defensive coach with the Chicago Bulls. Now, in his second season with the Wolves, the team still ranks in the bottom part of the league in defensive rating (25th to be exact). Many people believe that Thibs isn’t a good defensive coach, but instead, he was gifted great defensive talent in Chicago. That is not completely the case. The main thing with defense is the desire to stop the opponent, something the Wolves have put on display at times, but something that has been super inconsistent.</p> 

<p>The only thing is, the Timberwolves are actually not as bad at defense as it seems. The regular starting group for the Wolves this season ranks in the top half of the league in defensive rating. Sub in Tyus for Teague with the starters and then the Wolves’ defensive rating gets ridiculously good at 94.9. The problem on the defensive end has come with the bench and Jamal Crawford in particular. When Jamal is on the court, the Wolves’ defensive rating plummets. Jimmy Butler, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Andrew Wiggins all have defensive ratings of under 106 when they play without Jamal. When they play with Jamal, that rating skyrockets to over 115 for each player. The point is, the coach doesn’t have everything to do with the defense. The Wolves’ young guys are getting better at defense, thanks to not only Jimmy and Taj, but also Thibs. Obviously there is area to improve defensively, but the Wolves are actually not that far off from being a good defensive team.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Complaint Three: Thibs isn’t a relatable coach</b></h4>
<p>For all of the complaints about Tom Thibodeau, this might be the one I agree with most, but that doesn’t mean it can’t change. Thibs is an old school coach and that doesn’t mix in well with the young guys. However, Thibs has changed his coaching strategy in a way to work with the younger players, but his attitude hasn’t changed. My biggest complaint about Thibs is how little encouragement he gives the players during the game. He seems to give them a lot of compliments in the media, and maybe he does that during timeouts too, but on the sidelines, I think Thibs could applaud his players more when they make a good play. NBA fans always see coaches like Brad Stevens applauding his players after a big play. I think Thibs doing that for the Wolves could go a long way.<p>
<br>
<p>Taking a look at the Wolves’ season this year, it has definitely been an interesting ride. With two games remaining, the playoff possibilities for the Wolves remain nerve racking. However, the people that are calling to fire Thibs need to realize that the Wolves are back in the playoff mix for the first time in over a decade. Instead of getting greedy, enjoy that we could be seeing playoff basketball in Minnesota once again. The Wolves don’t get to this point without a solid coach. He obviously has some things he can improve upon as a coach, but people that say he is making no improvements to this team, or that he isn’t a good coach for this team, consider that the Wolves are one win against Denver away from being back in the postseason, something no Wolves fan should be complaining about.</p>
