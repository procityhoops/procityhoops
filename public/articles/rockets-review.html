<h1>Rockets Season Review</h1>

<h4>Current Status: 43-19, 3rd place in the Western Conference</h4>

<p>What a difference a season makes. At this time last year, Dwight Howard and JB Bickerstaff were fighting to keep their jobs, and James Harden was being called a fluke around the league. After major changes in the offseason that consisted of releasing Dwight Howard and hiring coach Mike D’Antoni, no team was a bigger question mark entering the season than the Houston Rockets. Many experts and fans alike wrote them off this season, but the Rockets have proved them all wrong. With 43 wins and 19 losses, the Rockets have claimed their spot among the NBA's elite and are looking to build upon their regular season success with a long playoff run.<p>
<br>

<h4><b>Regular Season Outlook:</b></h4>

<p>While Houston has impressed all season long, no win was more impressive than the 122-103 beat-down they handed the Clippers last Wednesday night. Harden and the Rockets have continued to grow their chemistry as the season progresses and newcomer Lou Williams has already fit seamlessly into their second unit. While Houston has struggled to solidify their own pace of play, their dominance has been on display since the All-Star break. For example;  in a game against Minnesota last weekend, Houston scored 142 points on 58 three-point attempts. Houston’s ability to control tempo and play their brand of basketball has been a staple of their success this season.</p>
<br>
<p>The Rockets should roll into the playoffs with home-court advantage in the first round with Utah, the eighth seed, six games behind them. In the playoffs, the Rockets will need to clamp down on the defensive end as high volume shooting teams have the tendency to struggle in May and June. While they may not play the "classic" brand of championship basketball, D’Antoni and co. will look to continue their hot shooting deep into the playoffs.<p>
<br>
<h4><b>Rockets MVP: James Harden</b></h4>

<p>Did you really expect anyone else's name to be highlighted here? James Harden has been absolutely sensational this season in Mike D’Antoni’s shoot-at-will system. Harden has displayed abilities that few others in the league possess. While Harden’s scoring ability has never been in doubt, he has raised his assist average this season to a career high 11.3 per game.  Mike D’Antoni has unleashed James Harden on the NBA this season and has played a large role in bringing Harden’s talent to new heights this season.</p> 
<br>
<h4><b>Postseason Outlook:</b></h4>

<p>With all of the success Houston has had this season, they will still need to navigate the gauntlet that is the Western Conference throughout playoff season. If the season ended today, Houston would be rewarded with a matchup against the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round of the playoffs. In this series, grit and grind meets run and gun. Which system will break first? If by the end of the season Houston does not draw the Grizzlies in the postseason, they will be tasked with a matchup against Oklahoma City, the LA Clippers or the Utah Jazz. If they can win their first series, the San Antonio Spurs or  the Golden State Warriors remain.</p> 
<br>
<p>Look for Houston to control the pace in the playoffs and ultimately lose out due to cold shooting. Jump shooting teams need to be a certain type of perfect to win consistently in the playoffs, something Golden State found out the hard way last season. However, if Houston can sneak into the Western Conference finals against Golden State, we will all be in for a treat.</p>
<br>
