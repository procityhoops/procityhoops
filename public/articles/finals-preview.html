<h1>NBA Finals Preview</h1>

<p>On Thursday night at 9 pm et, the Warriors and Cavaliers will kick off the 2017 NBA Finals. It will be the third straight meeting between the two teams in the NBA Finals. In 2015, the Warriors came away with the ring, and in 2016, the Cavaliers became the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3-1 deficit in the NBA Finals. Now, the trilogy.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Background</b></h4>
<p>The Warriors and Cavs met twice in the regular season with each team coming out on top once. The Cavs defeated the Warriors in a historic game on Christmas that saw Kyrie Irving put a sword in the back of the Warriors, much like he did last year in Game 7. On that Christmas day matchup, the Cavs big three combined for 76 points and led the Cavs to the win. Kevin Durant did all he could providing 36 points, but Steph Curry put up a measly 15 points, and the Warriors were handed the loss. The second matchup of the season was a blowout, to say the least. The Warriors defeated the Cavs by 35 points in the January matchup. The Warriors were led by Klay Thompson, who recorded 26 points in 31 minutes. LeBron and the Cavs had no answer for the Warriors, and they were throttled.</p>
<p>In the 2017 NBA Playoffs, the Golden State Warriors come into the NBA Finals with a perfect 12-0 record. Had it not been for Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals, the Cavaliers would also be perfect. Putting it mildly, the 2017 NBA Playoffs have not lived up to expectations. Thus far, there has only been two Game 7’s which both occurred in the early rounds. For the NBA Playoffs to be better than the regular season, the Cavs and Warriors series will have to be magnificent.</p>
<p>The Cavs and Warriors are both coming off of extended rest. The last time the Warriors laced up the shoes was last Monday, May 22nd. For the Cavaliers, the last time they stepped on the court was one week ago from today, Thursday, May 25th. So far, both teams have played the first game of their respective series in the playoffs coming off a lot of rest. However, only the Cavaliers have handled the extended rest well. The Warriors had some difficulties in Game 1 against the Spurs and had Kawhi Leonard not gotten hurt, the Spurs would have won Game 1. The Cavaliers, however, have had numerous good performances coming off of extended rest, and it seems like the regular season resting might give them an edge in this series. Although the extended rest will only play a factor in one game, it is something to keep an eye on going into Game 1 of the NBA Finals.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Key Matchups</b></h4>
<p>The main matchup that everyone is looking forward to is LeBron James versus Kevin Durant. Kevin Durant took on the “If you cannot beat them, join them” tactic this summer and joined the powerful Warriors, and LeBron James is chasing the iconic Michael Jordan. LeBron James has been on a tear in the postseason averaging 32.5 points, 8 rebounds, and 7 assists per game thus far. However, the even more impressive number for LeBron? He is shooting 42.1% from three-point territory, which will need to be a big part of his game if the Cavaliers have a chance in the series. Kevin Durant is also putting up some impactful numbers this postseason. He is averaging 25.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 3.7 assists per game. The two are almost guaranteed to guard each other and whoever wins this matchup could very well be hoisting the Larry O’Brien Trophy at the end.</p>
<p>Another key matchup in the series will be Steph Curry against Kyrie Irving. This is a matchup of the point guards even though Klay Thompson will likely be guarding Irving. Curry has been performing quite well in the postseason up to this point, and if the Warriors want revenge on the Cavs, he will need to continue to play well. He is averaging 28.6 points per game and knocking down 43.1% of his threes. Since LeBron James will be on Kevin Durant, Steph Curry will have to continue to step up in a big way. As for Kyrie Irving, he is usually the one with the ball in his hands at the end of games. As he has proven, Irving can knock down clutch shots when it matters most. He has averaged 24.5 points per game in these playoffs, but it seems like when the brightest lights are on, and the entire world is watching, Kyrie Irving comes to play. Irving will be guarded by Thompson, and he will need to utilize his speed off the dribble to attack the lane. Irving has the potential to explode in this series and possibly lead the Cavaliers to the title.</p>
<p>Kevin Love, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson will also play a big role in the series. Love has looked as comfortable as ever in these playoffs, but he may have a hard time in the NBA Finals if Draymond Green guards him. Green will need to provide his energy and effort and stay out of trouble. Last year, Green was suspended for Game 5 of the NBA Finals, and the Warriors lost a lot of momentum because of it. Klay Thompson has been rather cold in the postseason so far, but he has the potential to turn it on at any time. Thompson is averaging 14.4 points per game and shooting just 36.3% from three-point land in these playoffs. If the Warriors want an extra boost in the series, it would help if Klay Thompson finds his mojo.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Prediction</b></h4>
<p>Warriors in six. The Cavaliers will put up a fight, but they will come up short against the star-studded Warriors. The Warriors are too deep and too talented to get beat in a seven-game series. LeBron James and the Cavs will do all they can, but in the end, Durant and Curry will be too much to handle.</p>
