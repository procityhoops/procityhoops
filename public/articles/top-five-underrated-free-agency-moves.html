<h4><b>5. Darren Collison</b></h4>
<p>The Indiana Pacers were able to ink Darren Collison to a two-year, $20 million deal in the opening phase of free agency. Collison is a 29-year-old point guard who has played his last three seasons in Sacramento. Collison is a starting-caliber guard who averaged 13.2 points and 4.6 assists per game last season. Collison is also a threat from three-point range. He has shot 38% from downtown over his career, and he shot a career-high 41.7% from deep last season. Darren Collison will be a great fit on the Indiana Pacers who just traded away Paul George. He will be able to create scoring for himself and get open looks for Myles Turner. Collison was brought in on a cheap contract that is team friendly. He is in the prime of his career, and if all goes well, he will be able to help the Pacers speed up the rebuilding process.</p>

<h4><b>4. Omri Casspi</b></h4>
<p>After little interest was shown elsewhere, Omri Casspi agreed to a one-year contract with the Golden State Warriors for the vet minimum. Casspi adds another terrific three-point shooter to the Warriors. He will be able to provide a scoring punch off the bench to get guys like Kevin Durant and Draymond Green more rest time. Casspi shot 34.9% from deep last season, but he was injured off-and-on the entire season. In the 2015-2016 season, Casspi shot 40.9% from three while averaging 11.8 points per game for Sacramento. This will be Casspi’s fourth team that he has played on in the last year, but he may have his best season from deep in the 2017-2018 season. Casspi will be able to sit in the corner and allow the Warriors’ playmakers to drive the lane and kick it out to him for an open three.</p>

<h4><b>3. Michael Carter-Williams</b></h4>
<p>The Bulls let the rights of Michael Carter-Williams go before free agency opened. That allowed him to sign a one-year, $2.7 million deal with the Charlotte Hornets. Carter-Williams will use this deal and season as a “prove it” type of year. He can enter back into free agency next season, and if he plays well for Charlotte this season, he will get a much bigger paycheck next offseason. For the Hornets, it’s a risk worth taking. The 2014 NBA Rookie of the Year still has a lot of potential. He has not been put in the best positions over his short career, but learning from Kemba Walker will be a great experience for Carter-Williams. If he turns out, he could help Charlotte get back to the postseason. If not, he’s only on a one-year deal, and Charlotte can let him walk next season.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>2. Patrick Patterson</b></h4>
<p>The Oklahoma City Thunder got one of the biggest steals in free agency when they agreed to a three-year, $16.4 million deal with Patrick Patterson. The Thunder had just acquired Paul George, and then they turned their focus to improving the depth around Westbrook and George. Patterson was a quality reserve for the Raptors last season averaging 6.8 points and 4.5 rebounds per game in just 24.6 minutes per night. Patterson is in the prime of his career, and he will likely start some games for the Thunder next to Steven Adams. Patterson will bring a high-energy player that flat out knows how to play. Patterson is on a very reasonable contract for a guy that could be a key contributor on a playoff team.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>1. Rudy Gay</b></h4>
<p>The San Antonio Spurs potentially got the steal of free agency. They agreed to a two-year, $17 million deal with Rudy Gay in the opening days of NBA Free Agency. The Spurs were hit hard in the Western Conference Finals last season when Kawhi Leonard went down with an injury, and the Spurs made sure they will have a better backup plan the next time around. Rudy Gay averaged 18.7 points and 6.3 rebounds per game for the Kings last season, and the fact that San Antonio got him on such a cheap deal is mind boggling. Gay will be able to start or come off the bench for the Spurs and provide instant offense. There is no doubt that Rudy Gay could become an NBA All-Star playing for Gregg Popovich and the Spurs.</p>
