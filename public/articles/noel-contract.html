<h1>Nerlens Noel to fetch a max contract?</h1>
<p>Nerlens Noel was traded from Philadelphia to Dallas at the trade deadline last season. Now, Noel might fetch a max contract this offseason. The NBA salary cap is expected to rise to $101 million this summer, and Noel is a restricted free agent. According to Scout.com, many teams will be willing to offer him a max contract. Dallas will have the chance to match any offer that Noel is given, but it is unclear at this point how much Dallas is willing to pay Noel. If Noel moves teams once again, it will be his third team in less than a half of a year.</p>
