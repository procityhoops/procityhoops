<h1>Drew Hanlen Question and Answer</h1>
<p>Drew Hanlen is a trainer to many young talents across the NBA. His business, PureSweat, has remarkably  been spread purely through word of mouth. Some of his clients names include Bradley Beal, Andrew Wiggins, Joel Embiid, Zach LaVine, and others. We recently interviewed Hanlen about his training programs, players, and experiences.</p>
<br>
<p>Q: How did you get the idea to start a basketball training program and how much did your experience at Belmont help you?</p>
​<br>
<p>A: I started working with players around the St Louis area when I was a junior in high school and word-of-mouth spread. I studied Entrepreneurship at Belmont which helped me expand my business knowledge.</p>
<br>
<p>Q: With the continued development of Andrew Wiggins, how nice is it to see his work from the offseason paying off?</p>
<br>
<p>A: He's started the season well and showed big time improvements with his shot. Now, we're working towards becoming more consistent game in game out.</p>
<br>
<p>Q: What kinds of mechanics and focuses go into your training with guys like Joel Embiid, Andrew Wiggins, and Zach Lavine?</p>
<br>
<p>A: Everything is detailed and customized to the player.</p>
<br>
<p>Q: How different is it training veterans like David Lee and even Bradley Beal compared to younger guys like Andrew Wiggins, Zach Lavine, Joel Embiid, etc.?</p>
<br>
<p>A: Working with guys like David Lee and Jameer Nelson is a lot different than guys like Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid. Lee and Jameer have both been All-Stars and have been around the NBA, whereas Wiggins and Embiid are hungry to become All-Stars. The more experienced a player is, the more we lock in on their role, whereas the younger the player is, the more we focus on growth.</p>
<br>
<p>Q: How much of an importance does film play into training sessions?</p>
<br>
<p>A: A ton. It's a great way to improve while resting the body.</p>
<br>
<p>Q: Did you expect Joel Embiid to come in and put on a show in his first year in the NBA or did you expect it to take some time?</p>
<br>
<p>A: Yes. He is a gifted player and I knew he would be dominant from the start.</p>
<br>
<p>Q: Obviously the most training comes in the summer, but how much training do you and your clients go through during the season?</p>
<br>
<p>A: During the season, we'll make tweaks and adjustments but the heavy load of improvement comes in the off-season.</p>
<br>
<p>Q: With Andrew Wiggins was one of his main offseason focuses had to be three point shooting. How much work did he put in this summer to get that clip at what right now is near the top of the NBA?</p>
<br>
<p>A: Obviously, he has came back down to earth now, but he should finish the season shooting in the mid-40 percent range. We were making hundreds of shots a day to perfect his mechanics.</p>
<br>​
<p>Sometimes, people can just lose sight of what a player does to train once he gets to the NBA. It can be interesting to see what goes on behind the scenes with performance trainers such as Hanlen.</p>
