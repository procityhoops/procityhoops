<h1>2017 NBA Draft Steals</h1>

<p>The 2017 NBA draft class was one of the deepest in memory. While there were no big slides from the prospects, there was still great value to be had late into the night. Because there were so many choices, it was tough to decide on who to select from each round, but here we go.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>First Round Candidates:</b> Malik Monk, John Collins, Harry Giles</h4>
<p>I’ll start with the case for <b>Malik Monk</b>. The known sharpshooter from the University of Kentucky slid a few picks from where he was projected to go pre-draft. Monk can not only shoot the ball at a high efficiency, but he has under-the-radar athleticism, and has defensive upside as well. Monk had many high flying dunks in high school and college that went fairly unnoticed leading up to the draft and normally surprise people when they see them. The Hornets took a player that fits perfectly into their system and is sure to be a fan favorite. While he was still picked at #11, the fact that he slid a few selections makes him a candidate for this award.</p>
<p>Next up is <b>John Collins</b>. The generic named forward that flew seemingly out of nowhere to become a projected mid first round pick was selected by Atlanta at #19. Collins is an athletic big with a high ceiling and will hope to replace Dwight Howard in Atlanta. Averaging over 19 points, nearly ten rebounds and 1.6 blocks per game at Wake Forest, Collins has the potential to become the best big man in this draft if put into the right situation. His potential and good work ethic make Collins a top choice for steal of the first round.</p>
<p>Lastly, <b>Harry Giles</b>. If it wasn’t for the “one and done” rule, Harry Giles would’ve been a top three selection in the 2016 NBA Draft. Giles has torn an ACL in both his left and right knees which make him a boom or bust pick in this draft. Playing only 11.5 minutes in a measly 26 games at Duke, Giles had a lackluster college career. Yet despite all of this, Giles could ultimately become one of if not the best player in this draft. His pure talent is unmatched by anyone and he is a perfect fit for the young Sacramento Kings. If given the time to progress and come into the NBA slowly, he is going to lead the Kings into a new era alongside Justin Jackson and De’Aaron Fox.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Second Round Candidates:</b> Monte Morris, Semi Ojeleye</h4>
<p><b>Monte Morris</b> was an elite scorer for Iowa State and led them to a March Madness appearance in college. At pick 51, Morris was a good talent left on the board and was considered one of the most underrated players in this class. While it is likely he will never become a star player, I would compare Morris to Mo Williams as of right now. The comparison makes sense because Morris will start his career as a backup but could turn into a starter if put in the right situation. He can shoot from anywhere on the floor but can still distribute even as an undersized guard.</p>
<p><b>Semi Ojeleye</b> is the next candidate for the second round. Semi has already showed he has a polished shooting form and at 6’7” 235 lbs, he has good size for an NBA small forward. After transferring from Duke after his freshman year, he scored at a good rate last season at SMU. Ojeleye was another prospect that slipped out of the first round. The only reason Semi won’t turn out is the team he was drafted to. Boston is overloaded at the three after the draft and it will be tough for Ojeleye to find playing time.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>The Pick: Harry Giles</b></h4>
<p>While it was a very tough choice to make, I went with the biggest boom potential. If Giles can slowly come along into his own in the league, he is definitely going to surprise some people. While I still think all of the choices I made can be great players in the NBA, the biggest steal in the draft is Harry Giles.</p>
