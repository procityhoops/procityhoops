<p>On Saturday night, the Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics agreed to a trade that will send the top pick in the 2017 NBA Draft to Philadelphia. The trade won’t be made final until Monday when the trade call occurs, but the trade is a done deal. In return for the #1 pick, the Celtics will receive the third pick in the 2017 NBA Draft and a protected pick in 2018 via LAL. The protection on the pick is simple: if the Lakers pick falls between pick two and five next year, Boston gets the pick. If not, the Celtics will get the Sacramento Kings pick unprotected in 2019.</p>
<p>The trade is a rare win-win situation for both teams. The Sixers add to their already exciting young core. If everyone stays healthy, they will go into the season with Joel Embiid, Markelle Fultz, Ben Simmons, and Dario Saric leading the charge. A young core similar to that of the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2011-2012 when they made the NBA Finals with Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Serge Ibaka paving the way. Every player on the Sixers will benefit from having Markelle Fultz on the team. His drives to the hole will open up shots for everyone around him. For Boston, they add to their already heaping pile of assets. It’s possible that the Celtics could turn around and make another trade (as many NBA executives are expecting). With the trade happening well in advance of Draft night, NBA fans will be wondering all week about what else Boston will be up to. It’s possible that they make a call to Chicago and Indiana about Jimmy Butler and Paul George, but don’t be surprised if they trade for even more picks before Thursday night.</p>
