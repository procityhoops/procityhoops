<p>As it is often the case, when a player is selected in the middle of the second round of the NBA Draft, they are often forgotten about, they usually do not turn into anything special. But, a handful of players overcome the challenges and defeat the critics. One of those players: Nikola Jokic. When Jokic was taken with the 41st pick in the 2014 NBA Draft, he was doubted, many predicted that he would become an afterthought in just a few short years like many other second round picks, but that did not turn out to be the case.</p>
<p>Jokic has played for the Denver Nuggets for two seasons now, and he has been nothing short of impressive. Climbing up the ranks of the top centers in the NBA, Jokic averaged 16.7 points, 9.8 rebounds, and 4.9 assists per game last season in just 27.9 minutes per game. Post NBA All-Star break, when Jokic averaged 29.9 minutes per game, he put up 17.7 points, 11.6 rebounds, and 6.1 assists per game. Those numbers are not only great numbers for a center in the NBA, they are great numbers for any player in the NBA today. He ranked sixth in scoring for centers last season, and he was ranked second in assists per game for centers, trailing Al Horford by just 0.1 assists per game while Jokic played 4.4 minutes less than Horford each night. Jokic’s assist numbers were so impressive last season that he would have been tied for 25th in the point guard assist per game rankings ahead of starting point guards like Tony Parker, Derrick Rose, and D’Angelo Russell.</p>
<p>Possibly even more impressive than his assist per game numbers was how well he shot two-point field goals last season. In his rookie year, Jokic shot 54.1% on two-point field goals. Last season, Jokic increased that total by 8.7%, shooting 62.8% on two-point field goals. The 62.8% two-point field goal percentage ranked him seventh in the NBA last season even though he took 91 or more shots than the players ranked ahead of him.</p>
<p>With Jokic being so young, there are many more ways that he can improve his game. Some of them will just come with age and experience in terms of how to handle different game situations that arise throughout the season. With the arrival of Paul Millsap, the “Joker”, as Nuggets fans like to call him, will have a lot of pressure lifted from his shoulders in the 2017-18 NBA season.</p>
<p>In addition to Jokic needing to be more poised in high-pressure situations, it will be crucial for him to continue to work on his three-point stroke. He shot the three at a 32.4% clip last season, but in today’s NBA, it would help him immensely to get that up to at least 36%. If Jokic can improve his three-point shot and continue to dominate in the low-post, there will be no way that teams can guard him. If teams press up on the three-point line, Jokic has the ball skills to blow by his defender and take him to the hoop. If a team doubles Jokic in the post, he has the vision to find an open teammate. And finally, if Jokic is left open from three-point range, he will need to make the opposing team pay and knock down the shot. Considering Jokic is just 22 years old on a rising Denver Nuggets team, fans around the NBA could potentially be staring at the next big player in the NBA.</p>
