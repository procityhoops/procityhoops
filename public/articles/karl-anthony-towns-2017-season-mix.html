<p>Karl-Anthony Towns had a tremendous sophomore season in the NBA. He was the Timberwolves leading scorer and rebounder averaging 25.1 points and 12.3 rebounds per game. He had many highlight plays that consisted of clutch shots, big dunks, and step-back jumpers. There is no doubt that Towns will be in the league for a long time, and he will be one of the best big men in the NBA for the next 10-15 years. Take a look back at some of his best moments in this ProCity Hoops' original video.</p>
