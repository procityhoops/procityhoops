<p>Believe it or not, we’re here. Roughly 25 percent of the way through the 2017-18 season, time flies when you’re having fun.</p>
<p>The Boston Celtics were dealt a blow of utter tragedy with the Gordon Hayward loss night one and rebounded with an inexplicable 16 game win streak. There are troubles in paradise for our reigning MVP, the Oklahoma City Thunder are an utterly puzzling three games under .500! When are we going to see Kawhi Leonard? So much has happened and yet, we have so very far to go until the Warriors remind us all why the early season narratives mean so little.</p>
<p>It’s important to take stock of the awards on a regular basis, it may seem like overkill but don’t forget how close the MVP race was last season. The race was swung in large part due to a late run of dominance from Russell Westbrook. The entire year should be accounted for. Early play matters, wins in October don’t weigh less than wins in March. So, without any further delay, our pick for the winners a quarter of the way through.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Rookie of the Year</b></h4>
<p>Ben Simmons. Who else, this isn’t a conversation, it can’t be. Simmons has emerged from his year out in epic fashion. If Kristaps Porzingis is the unicorn, Simmons is a phoenix rising from the ashes of an unremarkable last two years.</p>
<p>Simmons is averaging: 19 PPG, 9.4 RPG, 7.9 APG, with a 20.3 PER and a .529 TS%.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia 76ers are fifth in the Eastern Conference and the process has taken a huge step forward. Simmons isn’t a shooter, he may never be an outside marksman but he knows that. Simmons awareness level is truly remarkable. The playmaking and athleticism were a given but few players have a grasp on their own limitations the way Simmons does. Give me a guy who makes smart plays rather than forces tough shots, every day, all day. The Sixers ball movement on a whole is beautiful and it starts with Simmons.</p>
<p><i>Runner up: Jayson Tatum</i></p>
<br>
<h4><b>Sixth Man of the Year</b></h4>
<p>Tyreke Evans. Welcome back Tyfreak! The former two-time Sacramento King has been stupendous in Memphis.</p>
<p>Evans is averaging: 17.7 PPG, 5.1 RPG, 3.4 APG, with a 22.8 PER and a .596 TS%.</p>
<p>Evans is accomplishing the above in just 28.2 MPG off the pine for the struggling Grizzlies. A career 30 percent shooter from the three-point line, Evans is shooting 41 percent from there this season and that’s on 4.2 attempts per game. With Mike Conley hurt and Marc Gasol struggling, you could legitimately argue Evans has been the team’s best player. Quite a feat for a guy used as throw in deal last season. Don’t forget, Evans is only making $3.29 million this season!</p>

<h4><b>Most Improved Player</b></h4>
<p>Victor Oladipo. I love this award because it’s a placeholder for so very many different themes. If it’s a matter of natural progression, it’d go to a star every year. Porzingis is a good example, we all knew he was a star, most of us knew with Carmelo Anthony and Derrick Rose no longer stalling the offense he’d soar. If it’s a matter of resurgence, a comeback we didn’t see coming, then I’d have to give it to Evans who has suddenly returned to where he was as a rookie eight years ago. However, I like the element of surprise here, the entire universe dumped on Kevin Pritchard for the Paul George trade and look how well both Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis are playing now!</p>
<p>Oladipo is averaging: 22.8 PPG, 5 RPG, 3.7 APG, with a 21.2 PER and a .572 TS%.</p>
<p>Those numbers are superior to both of Paul George and Carmelo Anthony this season, for those keeping track at home.</p>
<p><i>Runner up: Kristaps Porzingis</i></p>
<br>
<h4><b>Coach of the Year</b></h4>
<p>Brad Stevens. Let’s not deliberate on this one. Hayward goes down, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are thrust into leading roles way ahead of the projected timeline and they still dominate. Terry Rozier, Tatum, Brown, and even Aron Baynes are all producing ahead of where even the most courageous analysts imagined. Kyrie Irving has been good, Al Horford has been better than expected. Caps off to Stevens, seriously.</p>
<p><i>Runner up: Stan Van Gundy</i></p>
<br>
<h4><b>Defensive Player of the Year</b></h4>
<p>Al Horford. The best defensive player on the best defensive team. These awards are premature by nature but DPOY is truly lacking a frontrunner. Kevin Durant and Draymond Green both have a case but that almost takes away from the merit of either. The Celtics success can be attributed to a platoon approach and excellent coaching but also Horford who has been their rock at both ends. Horford’s ability to switch on screens and alter shots is impressive. He’s also having his best rebounding season in five years.</p>
<p>Al Horford is averaging: 13.7 PPG, 8.3 RPG, 4.9 APG, with a 19.2 PER and a .628 TS%.</p>
<p><i>Runner up: Draymond Green</i></p>
<br>
<h4><b>Most Valuable Player</b></h4>
<p>James Harden. Any other answer at this juncture is preposterous. The Houston Rockets have the second-best record in the NBA and they did it with Chris Paul missing all but three games. Harden may find a way to fall into second place again but at this moment his stat line and the team’s success short handed make it impossible to spin anything against him.</p>
<p>Harden is averaging: 31.4 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 9.8 APG, with a 29.9 PER and a .620 TS%.</p>
<p>Harden has stepped it up again! He’s leading the league in PPG and APG. A feat that has only ever been accomplished once by Nate “Tiny” Archibald back in 1972-73! It’s a powerful note that could steer the MVP race later in the season.</p>
<p><i>Runner up: LeBron James</i></p>
