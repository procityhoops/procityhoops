<h1>The Long and Fruitful Journey of Hassan Whiteside</h1>

<p>Hassan Whiteside is easily the biggest steal in Miami Heat history. But his path to success was nothing short of grueling, yet extraordinary.</p>
<p>After a successful collegiate career at the University of Marshall, averaging 13 points and 9 rebounds on 52% shooting with 5 blocks per game, he entered the NBA draft in 2010 and was selected by the Sacramento Kings with the 33rd overall pick. Unfortunately for Whiteside, he was only able to play one game his rookie season due to a partially torn tendon in his left knee that had to be surgically repaired, resulting in him missing the rest of the season. After a stint in the D-League in 2012, he was able to get back on the court for the Sacramento Kings, averaging a very pedestrian 1.6 points and 2.2 rebounds per game in just 18 games. Not long thereafter the Kings waived him and he was picked up by none other than the Sioux Falls Skyforce, the D-League team affiliated with the Miami Heat. But it was not yet meant to be for Hassan Whiteside as he was traded less than a month later to the Rio Grande Valley Vipers, the D-League team affiliated with the Houston Rockets.</p>

<p>After his time in the D-League, Whiteside decided to take his talents overseas to China where he averaged 25 points, 16 rebounds, and 5 blocks in just 27 games, aiding them to the 2013 NBL championship. After a few more dead-end stints with Lebanese and Chinese ball clubs, Whiteside signed with the Memphis Grizzlies in 2014. That would not work out either as he was waived several times, traded to the Iowa Energy (Minnesota Timberwolves), waived a couple more times, until FINALLY, Hassan Whiteside signed once again with the Miami Heat.</p>
<p>The Miami Heat were the first team to really stick with Hassan Whiteside, recalling him from Sioux Falls Skyforce on December 13th, 2014, just two days after being assigned there. The Heat stuck with him after a pedestrian first month with the team where he averaged 3.9 points and 3.7 rebounds in just 10 minutes per game. But the Heat were not discouraged, they gave him an opportunity to prove all his hard work, all his stints in the D-League, all his stints overseas had paid off. In his second month with the team, he took off as fast as Jeremy Lin during “Linsanity” in New York, only the difference being Whiteside’s emergence lasted longer than just a week. During the month of January, the Heat saw something in Hassan that no other team had seen before, a big man with superstar potential. In Whiteside’s second month on the team he started out by posting his first ever double-double against the Brooklyn Nets, dropping 11 points with 10 rebounds.</p>
<p>Just two games later a star was born when Whiteside completely dominated the Los Angeles Clippers and dropped 23 points, 16 rebounds, and 2 blocks on 10-13 shooting in 29 minutes. After the game Whiteside was interviewed as the player of the game where he told the media “I got a chip on my shoulder, every team in the NBA said no to me.” After being asked how he wants to continue this story Whiteside simply answered with “Just keep building, never settle and just keep building on it.” And keep building he certainly did, providing 6 double-doubles in total at the end of the month, along with a triple-double where he posted a career-high 12 blocks against the Chicago Bulls all while coming off the bench.</p>
<p>When coach Erik Spoelstra was asked what Whiteside brings to the table for the Heat, Spoelstra raved about him, telling the media, “He brings size obviously on both ends of the court, defensively he’s helping us protect the rim and vertical spacing on the offensive end. But the most important thing now is to be able to sustain that.” Hassan Whiteside did just that the rest of the season as he put the league on notice that there is a new dominant big man in the league. He ended the season averaging a double-double with 11.8 points, 10 rebounds, and 2.6 blocks per game. When asked about his attitude and mentality off the court Coach Spoelstra praised him, claiming “It’s been solid, that’s what we talked about from day one, it’s not about the minutes it’s not about the result yet. My eyeball to eyeball conversation to him in November was about the program, and embrace the work. With all of that he’s been very committed to that work.” Spoelstra continued about Whiteside’s involvement in the Heat’s program, exclaiming “He embraced it and I think it helped his perspective and his experiences the last couple years and he’s embraced the commitment to player development, to the work, and learning our system.”</p>
<p>Whiteside went on to becoming the Miami Heat’s full-time starter for the next three years, thriving under the Heat’s system. Posting career highs every year, Whiteside only continues to grow averaging 13.6 points, 11.4 rebounds, and 2.6 blocks per game for his career.</p>
<p>After everything he has been through, all Hassan Whiteside needed was a chance, and the Miami Heat gave him that, allowing for a star to be born down in South Beach.</p>
