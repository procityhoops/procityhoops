<h1>Need Based Mock Draft</h1>
<div id="author">
<p>By: Cole Henjum</p>
</div>
<p>The NBA Finals started on Thursday night which means the NBA Draft is approaching quickly. In less than three weeks, teams will make some of the biggest decisions of the offseason and usher in one of the best draft classes in years into the league. Each group of team executives will use one of two strategies on draft night: take the best player available or draft a player that fills a need.</p>
<p>Drafting the best player available is the safest way to get a high quality player at each pick in the draft. Drafting based on team needs can be a lot riskier and often ends up in busts. A classic example of this happened in 2013 when the Cavaliers used the top pick to select Anthony Bennett at power forward over Victor Oladipo at shooting guard. Kyrie Irving was beginning to show signs of being a perennial All-Star so another scoring guard was unneeded but Bennett never developed into the player some thought he could be. However, drafting based on need has also been utilized by Gregg Popovich and R.C. Buford to develop some of the best role players in the league.</p>
<p>In this mock draft, the selections will be based on which player fills the biggest need for each team. The picks will be made under two assumptions. First, each team will keep its first round picks. Second, each team will be making the picks with their current roster unless otherwise noted.</p>

<p><b>1. Celtics: Markelle Fultz, G, Washington</b></p>
<p>Danny Ainge deserves all the credit he receives for dumping Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce to the Nets right when they began to exit their primes. The Celtics are now in the perfect position to draft whichever prospect fits best. Markelle Fultz will pair perfectly with Isaiah Thomas to form a backcourt that could compete with the Warriors and Raptors as the best backcourt in the league.</p>

<p><b>2. Lakers: Lonzo Ball, G, UCLA</b></p>
<p>The Lakers also need a guard to pair with an established playmaker, and luckily for them, this draft is loaded with point guards. Lonzo Ball will put D’Angelo Russell in his more natural position as a playmaking shooting guard rather than a point guard. Ball and Russell will form one of the most exciting backcourts in the league to go along with Brandon Ingram and Julius Randle on a team that could compete for championships for many years to come.</p>

<br><br>
<p><b>3. 76ers: Josh Jackson, F, Kansas</b></p>
<p>This is a tough pick for the 76ers because they are determining the direction of their team for many years to come. Their biggest need is at forward with Ben Simmons set to make his NBA debut as a non-traditional point guard next year and T.J. McConnell coming on strong at the end of the year. An athletic, defensive minded small forward like Josh Jackson who can pair with Joel Embiid to form a terrific defensive frontcourt will work wonders for the Sixers.</p>

<p><b>4. Suns: Jonathan Isaac, F, Florida State</b></p>
<p>Jonathan Isaac makes a huge jump here compared to most mock drafts because of the Sun's current roster. They have too many guards with Tyler Ulis, Devin Booker, Brandon Knight, and Eric Bledsoe as quality NBA players. But they also have Tyson Chandler, Dragan Bender, and Alex Len as bigs either looking to develop or, in Chandler’s case, an established big. With Josh Jackson off the board, the Suns look to the next small forward in Isaac who reminds some scouts of Kevin Durant with less of a knack for scoring and more of a knack for defense.</p>

<p><b>5. Kings: De’Aaron Fox, G, Kentucky</b></p>
<p>After dealing Demarcus Cousins to the Pelicans mid-season, the Kings are now fully committed to tanking. Sacramento’s roster is filled with players, such as Buddy Hield and Willie Cauley-Stein, who are worth developing for the long run, and other players, such as Rudy Gay and Ty Lawson, who don’t fit a long term plan. The only position where the Kings truly lack any depth is at point guard. Fox should be able to come in and make an impact as an exciting lead guard.</p>

<p><b>6. Magic: Dennis Smith Jr., G, North Carolina State</b></p>
<p>Elfrid Payton is a decent NBA point guard and improved this past season enough to show that he belongs in the league long term. However, he hasn’t improved enough to be the leader of a playoff-caliber team. Dennis Smith has the athleticism and leadership to be a high-level point guard for years to come. He may be the fourth best point guard in the draft, but all four point guards have the potential to be All-Stars a few years down the road.</p>

<br><br>
<p><b>7. Timberwolves: Jarrett Allen, C, Texas</b></p>
<p>The Timberwolves have a bunch of young studs that are either already becoming stars or are sure to show progress in the immediate future. Minnesota had one of the worst defenses in the league last year, and the biggest need is an interior defensive presence to help Karl-Anthony Towns. Allen is the ideal player to do this with his outstanding length and athleticism. He rebounded very well in one of the toughest conferences in the country and also defends the pick and roll successfully.</p>

<p><b>8. Knicks: Malik Monk, G, Kentucky</b></p>
<p>The Knicks are in total disarray. Trading for Derrick Rose last summer was supposed to start a new big three era in New York with Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis. That didn’t work, and now the Knicks need young playmakers. Monk fits that perfectly after having several huge scoring games in his lone season at Kentucky.</p>

<p><b>9. Mavericks: Frank Ntilikina, G, France</b></p>
<p>Mark Cuban has said the biggest need for the Mavericks is a pass-first point guard. The best international prospect is a perfect fit for what Dallas is looking for. He will be 19 years old at the beginning of the season and should help the Mavericks push for one last playoff run with Dirk Nowitzki.</p>

<p><b>10. Kings: Jayson Tatum, F, Duke</b></p>
<p>Sacramento makes its second selection of the lottery on a player who fell simply because he didn’t fit another team’s needs. Tatum should be an All-Star in the league for many years to come because of his size and versatility. A lineup of Fox and Tatum paired with Hield and Cauley-Stein may need time to develop, but they would certainly be a fun team to watch.</p>

<p><b>11. Hornets: Terrance Ferguson, G, Australia</b></p>
<p>One of the more disappointing teams in the NBA this past season was the Charlotte Hornets. If the rest of the team can step up and help Kemba Walker, one of the only needs is outside shooting. Ferguson was one of the most exciting players in the 2016 high school class but chose to play overseas. His outside shooting and explosiveness will be fun to watch for a team like the Hornets.</p>

<p><b>12. Pistons: Luke Kennard, G, Duke</b></p>
<p>The Pistons are another team that had a disappointing year based on their roster. They are loaded in the frontcourt with several small forwards and Andre Drummond dominating the paint. Kennard should provide a spark plug off the bench for the Pistons early in his career with his outside shooting and ability to get into the paint.</p>

<br><br>
<p><b>13. Nuggets: Harry Giles, F, Duke</b></p>
<p>The Nuggets are in a position where their biggest need is to sign a star in free agency. In the draft, they should select Harry Giles who will have time to develop and show what he can do working alongside Nikola Jokic. Success in the NBA for Giles will likely be determined by his health. If he can stay healthy, he should develop into the exciting player he was in high school.</p>

<p><b>14. Heat: Lauri Markkanen, F, Arizona</b></p>
<p>The Heat look for a stretch big at pick 14 to pair with the inside presence of Hassan Whiteside. Markkanen had a solid year for Arizona and showed that he could be a top-level forward in the league. The Heat also need to sign a star in free agency, but drafting Markkanen should help spread out the offense.</p>

<p><b>15. Trail Blazers: Hamidou Diallo, G, Kentucky</b></p>
<p>The Blazers are in a tough spot this offseason. They have 16 players under contract for next season with no player or team options. If they keep their picks, one of their biggest needs is backup guards to help take some of the scoring load off of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum, and Diallo should be able to provide just that.</p>

<p><b>16. Bulls: T.J. Leaf, F, UCLA</b></p>
<p>T.J. Leaf is the type of forward that every team in the league wants. His ability to play both inside and outside makes him one of the more versatile players in the middle part of the first round. Leaf should mesh well with whichever big names stay on the Bulls next year.</p>

<p><b>17. Bucks: Ivan Rabb, F, California</b></p>
<p>The Bucks are one of the longest teams in the NBA but for some reason, they struggled with post play throughout the year. Rabb was an electrifying prospect in the high school class of 2015 and after his freshman year of college, he chose to return to college and develop his game for another year. Coming off the bench as a big man for the Bucks could put him in a situation similar to Myles Turner where he isn’t the best player in the draft class, but he plays important playoff minutes early in his career.</p>

<img src="/assets/images/Slideshow/Ivan-Rabb.jpg">
<br><br>
<p><b>18. Pacers: Zach Collins, C, Gonzaga</b></p>
<p>The team with the most important offseason is the Indiana Pacers. They need to impress Paul George this offseason and regular season enough to sign him to a long-term deal next summer. Zach Collins may not be a household name for a lot of people, but he showed enough flashes at Gonzaga to merit a top draft pick. His all-around performance in the Final Four almost brought Gonzaga their first national championship.</p>

<p><b>19. Hawks: P.J. Dozier, G, South Carolina</b></p>
<p>The Hawks biggest need is a solid backup point guard to help Dennis Schroeder. P.J. Dozier is a bit of a stretch with the 19th pick, but the dropoff after the first five point guards is somewhat steep. Dozier paired with Sindarius Thornwell (More on Thornwell later) to make South Carolina the cinderella of this year’s NCAA tournament. His leadership should allow him to have a solid career as a backup point guard.</p>

<p><b>20. Trail Blazers: Rodions Kurucs, F, Latvia</b></p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the Blazers have a full roster already but could waive a few players if they are excited about their draft picks. Drafting Rodions Kurucs and storing him overseas for a couple years could be a beneficial move for the Blazers. Kurucs is a small forward who plays in Spain and has a game similar to Sam Dekker.</p>

<p><b>21. Thunder: Donovan Mitchell, G, Louisville</b></p>
<p>Russell Westbrook just had one of the most outstanding seasons of any individual player in NBA history. Despite that, the Thunder lost in the first round of the playoffs to a team that shot threes like they were layups. The Thunder draft Mitchell who is not an elite shooter, but showed signs of it at Louisville. He should provide an outside weapon to give Westbrook a kick out option when he attacks the basket.</p>

<p><b>22. Nets: Dwayne Bacon, G/F, Florida State</b></p>
<p>The Nets need pretty much everything but will struggle to get much because their first pick is at #22. Dwayne Bacon is a very good player to draft at this spot and should fit in with any team. At Florida State, he combined with Jonathan Isaac to have one of the more memorable seasons in program history. With the Nets, Bacon should get enough minutes to be able to tell what level of player he will be in the NBA.</p>

<p><b>23. Raptors: Sindarius Thornwell, G, South Carolina</b></p>
<p>Thornwell’s college teammate, P.J. Dozier is already off the board, but Thornwell is the gem from South Carolina’s Final Four team. Thornwell was virtually unknown until South Carolina’s second round win against Duke in the tournament. He plays with a passion for the game that only a few players each year have. He would do well starting his career off with the Raptors learning from DeMar DeRozan.</p>

<img src="/assets/images/Slideshow/Thornwell-Dozier.jpg">
<br><br>
<p><b>24. Jazz: Bam Adebayo, C, Kentucky</b></p>
<p>The top item on the agenda for the Jazz this offseason is for Gordon Hayward to sign a long-term extension. If the Jazz can keep Hayward, their franchise will be in good shape regardless of the draft. Adebayo is an extremely athletic center and could serve a role similar to Tristan Thompson of the Cavaliers. His willingness to do the dirty work will make him valuable for whichever team drafts him.</p>

<p><b>25. Magic: Kyle Kuzma, F, Utah</b></p>
<p>Having used their first pick on point guard Dennis Smith Jr., the Magic need a stretch big. Kuzma doesn’t have the shooting ability of T.J. Leaf, but he can step out and take long-range twos when necessary. The only problem will be how to divide the minutes on a team that already has Aaron Gordon, Nikola Vucevic, and Bismack Biyombo.</p>

<p><b>26. Trail Blazers: Isaiah Hartenstein, F, Germany</b></p>
<p>Another draft and stash player for the Trail Blazers with their third pick of the first round. Hartenstein has good raw skills that should develop well for a pick this late in the first round. A couple more years playing in Europe and he could end up being one of the better players in this year’s draft.</p>

<p><b>27. Nets: John Collins, F, Wake Forest</b></p>
<p>The Nets make their second pick of the first round at #27, but again it still isn’t as high as they need it to be. John Collins would be a steal at this point in the draft but could fall because of the depth of forwards in the middle stages of the first round. Collins is very physical and has the tools to be a good forward in the NBA. Playing with the Nets could help him get minutes early.</p>

<p><b>28. Lakers: Justin Patton, C, Creighton</b></p>
<p>The Lakers will get the player they wanted in Ball with the second pick and that leaves them to take a big. They don’t have a lot of depth in the post and Patton is a fun player to watch. With two of the better passers in the league in Ball and D’Angelo Russell, any player on this team is sure to get the looks they want.</p>

<p><b>29. Spurs: Edmond Sumner, G, Xavier</b></p>
<p>Anybody who has watched the NBA in the past two decades knows that Gregg Popovich and the Spurs don’t make bad decisions. Sumner may seem like an odd pick, but with Tony Parker slowing down, the Spurs will need young guards to help out Patty Mills. Sumner is a combo guard who makes team-first plays on both ends of the court.</p>

<p><b>30. Jazz: Frank Jackson, G, Duke</b></p>
<p>With the final pick of the first round, the Jazz take the fourth Duke player of this year’s draft class. Jackson likely won’t get many minutes early in his career, but he is still very young and was one of the most coveted guards coming out of high school. He has a good scoring rate but doesn’t have the size to be a top tier shooting guard in the NBA.</p>
