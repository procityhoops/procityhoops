<h1>Jarrett Allen Draft Profile</h1>

<p>Shaka Smart’s second season as head coach of Texas did not go as well as he would have hoped, but there was at least one bright spot. Jarrett Allen developed into one of the most promising NBA Draft prospects during his lone season at Texas. Standing 6’11” with shoes and 235 pounds, Allen has the size to play either power forward or center in the NBA. Allen’s best game, individually, was his 22-point and 19-rebound performance against the #2 ranked Kansas team. He had 12 double-doubles and slowly increased his scoring average as the year progressed. By the end of the year, Allen averaged 13.4 points per game, 8.4 rebounds per game, and 1.5 blocks per game in 32 minutes per game. Most draft experts now have him being drafted just outside the lottery between picks 15 and 18.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Strengths</b></h4>
<p>Potential is a risky factor in drafting a player based on, but every team wants to have a draft pick turn out like Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Bucks. Jarrett Allen has a fairly high ceiling right now for someone who at best will be a late lottery pick. He exploded into national notability just before his senior year of high school and is still developing as a player. One of the main reasons he is becoming such a big time prospect is because of his size. Allen is 6’11” in shoes and has a 7’5” wingspan which is solid height and length for an NBA center. He also has decent explosiveness vertically and will be a good lob target in his NBA career. In terms of skill, Allen is mostly still developing. The best part of his game is when he posts up with his back to the basket. He has elite footwork in the post and pairs that with his finishing moves to be able to score in a variety of ways near the rim. Another part of his game that NBA scouts are pleased with is his mid-range jump shot. Nearly every NBA player today needs to be able to shoot from outside ten feet in order to space the floor. Jarrett Allen was able to knock down mid-range jump shots with consistently good shooting form. Every now and then he utilized his athleticism on straight drives to the basket off a shot fake. In addition to all this, Allen still has room to put on muscle and grow skill wise.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Weaknesses</b></h4>
<p>Just like his greatest strength in terms of the draft, Jarrett Allen’s greatest weakness is not a basketball skill. His greatest weakness is his basketball IQ. He will develop this as he continues to play at a higher level, but it’s definitely not a guarantee that he will have a great mind for the game. Another weakness is that despite having the body type and athleticism of someone like Karl-Anthony Towns, Allen doesn't show the defensive prowess that a player like Towns had coming out of college. Allen doesn't have the toughness needed to be an elite center in the NBA. Adding a decent amount of muscle should help him develop this skill in order to be able to battle defensively in the post. His 1.5 blocks per game in college are not particularly impressive, and he will need to show whichever team he is drafted by that he has a willingness to do the dirty work required to help a team win. Similar to his block rate, his rebounding rate is solid but not as high as NBA teams will want for a top-notch starter. Individually, Allen’s weaknesses are nothing to be concerned about but combined there is enough cause for concern for lottery teams to look past Allen to more developed players. However, Allen still has the potential to be a starter in a couple years if he can grow both physically and mentally.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>NBA Comparison</b></h4>
<p>Joakim Noah. The main similarity here is that both Noah and Jarrett Allen have very solid offensive skillsets without being able to shoot from the outside like many big men can. As time goes on, Allen could become a great defensive stopper like Noah because Allen has the measurables and the athleticism that Noah had coming out of college. In addition, both have terrific vision for big men and make some nice bounce passes from the post.</p>
