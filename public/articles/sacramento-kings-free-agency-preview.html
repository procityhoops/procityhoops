<p>When the Sacramento Kings traded DeMarcus Cousins at the NBA Trade Deadline last season, most fans around the NBA thought they would enter a long rebuild. The Kings finished the 2016-2017 NBA season with a 32-50 record, putting them 12th in the Western Conference. Just a couple months after the Kings played their final game of the 2016-2017 season, Kings fans are excited about next season. The Kings had a terrific night last Thursday adding players like De’Aaron Fox, Justin Jackson, and Harry Giles in the NBA Draft. Add those players to Buddy Hield and Willie Cauley-Stein, and the Kings have a very exciting young core to build around. Now, the challenge for the Kings’ front office is to fill the rest of the roster out with veteran talent to show the young guys the way in the NBA.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $60 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: Langston Galloway, Ben McLemore<br>
Unrestricted: Darren Collison, Tyreke Evans, Rudy Gay, and Ty Lawson</p>
<p>The Kings have just about half of their team up for free agency. And every one of them played a lot of minutes for the team last season. The Kings will have to make a decision. They will need to decide whether they should bring their free agents back, or let them walk and focus on their young guys. If they decide to bring some of their guys back, look for them to try and retain Darren Collison. Collison would provide great stories and advice to incoming rookie De’Aaron Fox. However, with De’Aaron Fox in place, Collison will likely look for a starting job elsewhere. The Kings should be able to match any offer on their restricted free agents. Langston Galloway would be a solid backup point guard to De’Aaron Fox and would be able to give the rookie a breather when he needs one. Ben McLemore is still just 24 years old. He averaged 8.1 points per game last season, but he only played 19.3 minutes a night. Expect Tyreke Evans, Rudy Gay, and Ty Lawson to walk and try to find money and playing time elsewhere.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Serge Ibaka, Thabo Sefolosha</p>
<p>The Kings have the cap space to go much bigger in free agency, but a star will likely not consider Sacramento this summer. A guy like Serge Ibaka could slide into the power forward position and help the Kings space the floor. Ibaka would bring great energy and effort to the Kings night in and night out, and he would set a great example for the younger players. Thabo Sefolosha would be a pure veteran mentor. He could still give the Kings some solid minutes and contribute defensively, but he would be able to answer any questions that the young players might have. He also brings a toughness to the court and would teach the young guys how to stick up for their teammates.</p>
