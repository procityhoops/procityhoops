<h1>Jayson Tatum NBA Comparison</h1>

<p>Jayson Tatum had an up and down freshman season at Duke, but he was a reliable contributor during his only season in Durham. Tatum averaged roughly 17 points, 7 rebounds, and 2 assists per game with a true shooting percentage of 57%. Tatum can play either forward position, but he projects best as a small forward in the NBA. If Tatum can develop on the defensive side of the ball to defend power forwards, he could greatly improve his position as a stretch four in the association.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Best Case Comparison: Carmelo Anthony</b></h4>
<p>Tatum and Anthony had similar numbers in their freshman years of college, with the only outlier being Anthony’s national championship. While Tatum has a long way to go on the offensive end to become Anthony, his footwork and full offensive repertoire are similar to that of the 19-year-old version of Melo. Tatum’s 57% true shooting percentage, and ability to create from mid-range and in the mid-post should translate well to the NBA game.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Likely Comparison: Danny Granger</b></h4>
<p>While this is not meant as a knock on Tatum or Granger, this is a testament to Tatum’s ability and easily transferable skills to the pro game. Granger was a solid offensive option who was always the second, third, or fourth option on his team. Had Granger not gone through injury problems, he would have been an NBA All-Star for many years. But, Granger channeled his injuries and still became a solid starter in the NBA. If Tatum can carve out a role similar to Granger, he will have a long and successful NBA career.</p>
<p>Although Granger made the All-Star game in 2006, he was never able to stay healthy and lead a team like Carmelo once did. Whichever team drafts Tatum will be getting a solid offensive weapon who will fill up the stat sheet from day one. While his defense and three-point shooting need work, all the tools are there for Tatum to become a successful and integral piece to an offense sooner rather than later.</p>
