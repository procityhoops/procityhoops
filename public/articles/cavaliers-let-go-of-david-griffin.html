<h1>The Cavs will be hurt by Griffin's departure</h1>

<p>The Cavs have a lot of decision making to do this offseason after falling to the Warriors in five games in the 2017 NBA Finals. Aside from re-signing some players and making potentially franchise changing trades, they needed to re-sign David Griffin as their GM. They did not, and it will surely cost them.</p>
<p>To start, David Griffin assembled this team. In the summer of 2014, he was given LeBron James, and he would then make it his mission to put guys around him that will make it both easy for him and fun for him. His first order of business was getting Kevin Love to Cleveland, a proven big man with a shooting touch much like that of a former teammate of LeBron’s, Chris Bosh. Upon sending Andrew Wiggins away with Anthony Bennett and a draft pick, Love was officially a Cavalier to form the big three in Cleveland with Irving and James. Things got off to a rocky start as the Cavs would start just 19-20 as both chemistry and LeBron’s health was a concern. Many people started doubting “Griff” saying that he should have kept Wiggins.</p>
<p>However, he adjusted and saw exactly what the Cavs needed. He sent away Dion Waiters, who wasn't fitting with the newly assembled Cavaliers which somehow landed the Cavs a sharpshooter in J.R. Smith and defensive-minded, Iman Shumpert. Realizing the Cavs still needed size, he traded draft picks and wound up getting the exact combination of size and athleticism in Timofey Mozgov from the Nuggets. The Cavs would go 34-9 the rest of the season, tops in the NBA for that time period. Only injuries could slow down that team as they lost in six to the Warriors in the Finals.</p>
<p>Going into the summer of 2015 David Griffin realized the franchise was still in a good spot and he didn't make any major changes. However, he found a diamond in the rough kind of player in Richard Jefferson who still gets quality minutes even at his old age and has a great locker room impact. In addition, he signed former Cavalier, Mo Williams, to ensure enough backup for Kyrie Irving in the event Irving would go down like he did in the 2015 Finals.</p>
<p>Something still didn't feel right though. The Cavs sat at 30-11 halfway through the 2015-2016 campaign, good for first in the East, but a blowout loss at home to the Warriors and overall not beating the good teams in the NBA led Griffin to fire David Blatt, former coach of the Cavs, because he couldn't get everything out of his players. Instead, Griffin brought in the perfect kind of Coach for the Cavaliers, and for LeBron James in Tyronn Lue. He wasn't done there. He traded away a fan favorite, Anderson Varejao to receive Channing Frye. In a move that confused many, Frye ended up making a huge difference as he played an important role off the bench as a deadeye shooter. He even made the small move before the playoffs signing one of the better locker room guys to have on a team in Dahntay Jones which was a move praised by all on the team. In the end, the pieces all fit together and the city of Cleveland ended their 52-year championship drought after coming back from a 3-1 deficit in the NBA Finals to defeat the Warriors.</p>
<p>Finally, even though this season didn't end with a title, he somehow turned Mike Dunleavy into the Cavs weapon off the bench, Kyle Korver. He then went on to sign players like Deron Williams, Derrick Williams, and even Andrew Bogut though he got injured in his first game with the Cavs. Either way, this completely turned around the Cavs season and they were known as one of the deepest, smartest, and best shooting teams in the NBA. This offseason, he was in the midst of potentially getting Paul George or Jimmy Butler before being let go.</p>
<p>Griffin connected with these guys, plain and simple. When the Cavs were down 3-1, Griffin sent out an email to all of the players, and it is truly something to read. He was inspirational and just a mastermind behind every move. He was calculated, yet so approachable, and that’s what the players loved and admired about him. He will be deeply missed by this Cavs team. He always knew how to right the ship when things got bad. The question now becomes, who will right the ship nowadays as the Cavs will look for a new GM. Chauncey Billups, a good player in his day, but a man with zero GM experience, is a candidate.</p>
