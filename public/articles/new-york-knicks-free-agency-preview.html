<p>The New York Knicks are a mess, plain and simple. They finished the 2016-2017 NBA season with a record of 31-51, ranking them 12th in the Eastern Conference. Last Thursday, Phil Jackson listened to trade offers for star player Kristaps Porzingis. In addition, he is consistently trying to get Carmelo Anthony to waive his no-trade clause to get him out of New York. The Knicks are having a hard time getting back to where they want to be. The plan to bring in Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah failed miserably, and the Knicks are left wondering what to do. The lone bright spot, Kristaps Porzingis, turned in a solid sophomore season. He averaged 18.1 points and 7.2 rebounds per game for the Knicks. Carmelo Anthony also turned in a solid season, although he was heckled by Knicks fans all year. Melo averaged 22.4 points and 5.9 rebounds on the season which is solid numbers for a player exiting his prime. Now, the Knicks are trying to figure out how they can turn the franchise around and change the team’s culture in free agency.</p>

<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $20 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: Ron Baker<br>
Unrestricted: Justin Holiday, Derrick Rose, and Sasha Vujacic</p>
<p>Unlike some other teams, the New York Knicks have some solid players who are hitting the free agent market. Justin Holiday is a 28-year-old guard who averaged 7.7 points in 20 minutes per game for the Knicks last season. If Holiday continues to get consistent playing time, he will continue to improve his numbers and prove to be a quality player in the NBA. Derrick Rose has expressed interest in returning to the Knicks for a second season in New York. Rose averaged 18 points a night while playing 64 games for the Knicks in his first season playing at Madison Square Garden. The Knicks could consider bringing D-Rose back, but if they want to enter a rebuild, there is no point in him returning, especially after the team drafted point guard Frank Ntilikina last Thursday. As for Sasha Vujacic and Ron Baker, the Knicks will likely let them walk. Unless the team senses that a 24-year-old Ron Baker might have a future in the NBA, fans can expect to see Vujacic and Baker out the door.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Jonathan Simmons, Patty Mills</p>
<p>The New York Knicks can have up to $20 million to spend in free agency this offseason. The problem is, the Knicks aren’t competing for a playoff spot next season. They could make a large offer to Jonathan Simmons in hopes to pry him away from the Spurs. Simmons would give the Knicks an athletic option at the shooting guard position that would help Kristaps Porzingis lead the Knicks. Patty Mills would offer the Knicks some veteran presence and a veteran mentor for newly drafted Frank Ntilikina. Mills would also be able to come off the bench and provide the Knicks starters a nice rest. Notice anything about the Knicks free agent targets? They are both players from the San Antonio Spurs. The Knicks need to change their culture and what better way to do it than getting high-quality players from a high-quality organization. </p>
