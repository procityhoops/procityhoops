<p>The Houston Rockets had a tremendous 2016-2017 season. They finished third in the West with a record of 55-27. However, the Rockets were knocked off in the Western Conference Semifinals by the San Antonio Spurs in the 2017 NBA Playoffs. The Rockets had terrific three-point shooting all season, and they were led by MVP runner-up James Harden. Harden averaged 29.1 points, 11.2 assists, and 8.1 rebounds per game which were all career highs. He was also surrounded by terrific talent. The Rockets also had two of the top three candidates for NBA Sixth Man of the Year, including the winner Eric Gordon. Gordon averaged 16.2 points per game while playing 31 minutes a night, primarily off the bench. The Rockets also had guys like Ryan Anderson, Trevor Ariza, Patrick Beverley, Clint Capela, and Lou Williams who were all big contributors to Houston’s success. Now, the Rockets shipped what seemed like half of their team to acquire Chris Paul from the Los Angeles Clippers. Paul will team up with James Harden in the Rocket’s attempt to make a run at the Golden State Warriors. Now, the Rockets will need to put depth to surround Paul and Harden to make a solid run in the playoffs next season.</p>

<h4><b>Max Cap Space: -$2 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted:  Bobby Brown, Troy Williams<br>
Unrestricted: Nene Hilario</p>
<p>The Houston Rockets don’t have too much to worry about with their own players in free agency this offseason. They can let Bobby Brown and Troy Williams walk unless they come back on very small deals and need players to take roster space. They can offer Nene a small contract with the hope that he accepts the deal to become the backup big man for the Rockets. Houston doesn’t have to focus on their own players in free agency they need to get other players to provide depth to the roster.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>David Lee, PJ Tucker</p>
<p>The Houston Rockets will be set at their guard positions. What the Rockets need is some more experience and leadership off the bench. David Lee and PJ Tucker would be able to slide into a heavy bench role and play a major part on the Houston Rockets next season. David Lee would be a good leader on the bench who has experience winning. PJ Tucker would bring a defensive toughness to the team which can be instrumental for a championship team. With the core set into place, the main challenge for the Rockets in free agency will be finding pieces to place alongside Harden and Paul.</p>
