<p>The Cleveland Cavaliers currently trail the Golden State Warriors 2-0 in the 2017 NBA Finals. If the Cavs are defeated in four or five games, Chris Haynes of ESPN.com says the Cavs may not waste any time improving their roster. Haynes mentions small moves to improve the depth of the team, but he also says it isnâ€™t out of the question for the team to pursue Chris Paul and/or Carmelo Anthony. LeBron James has always had a desire to play with Paul and Anthony, who are all very close friends. Chris Paul will be a free agent this summer, and Carmelo Anthony will presumably be on the trade block.</p>
