<h4><b>#5. Kristaps Porzingis</b></h4>
<p>Coming out of the 2015 NBA Draft Knicks fans were weeping and disappointed in the selection of Kristaps Porzingis. Now, they are rejoicing as Porzingis has become one of the top young talents in the league. This season Porzingis has put up 18.1 points per contest and has also grabbed 7.2 rebounds each game. After a very impressive rookie season, Porzingis has gone on to post even more impressive numbers in his sophomore season. In spite of the problems out East, Knicks fans do have Porzingis to be happy about.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>#4. Devin Booker</b></h4>
<p>What else can be said about Devin Booker? The 20 year old out of Kentucky has put on a show for what has otherwise been a forgettable year for the Phoenix Suns. Booker is averaging 22.1 points per game and shooting 36.3% from downtown. He recently put up 70 points against the Boston Celtics; the most points in a single game since Kobe Bryant put up 81 points against the Raptors in 2006. Devin Booker is only improving and is the face of an up and coming Suns organization.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>#3. Nikola Jokic</b></h4>
<p>Who would've thought? Coming into the season nobody expected Nikola Jokic to explode as much as he has as a 22 year old. In his rookie season Jokic averaged 10 points per game in just under 22 minutes a night. This season he has averaged 16.7 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 4.9 assists per game. These numbers come at just 27.9 minutes per night. If you take those numbers to a per 36 minutes scale you get: 21.6 points, 12.6 rebounds, and 8.6 assists per night. Jokic led the charge in trying to lead Denver to the playoffs and for Denver and Jokic there is nowhere to go but up.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>#2. Giannis Antetokounmpo</b></h4>
<p>Giannis Antetokounmpo is called "The Greek Freak" for a reason. The man is an athletic freak that can jump out of the building and get way up to swat away a shot. The 22 year old has averaged 22.9 points, 8.7 rebounds, and 5.4 assists per night. The Greek Freak has led an injury plagued Milwaukee team to the playoffs with a chance to do some damage. Had Jabari Parker not gone down with an ACL Tear, the Bucks could very easily be sitting in a 4 seed in the East, but nevertheless they are sitting in the 6th spot thanks to Giannis Antetokounmpo.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>#1. Karl-Anthony Towns</b></h4>
<p>Karl-Anthony Towns is part of the evolving NBA game where if you are a big man you need to be able to shoot the ball. Towns can not only knock down the jumper at an efficient rate, but he also does work on the post that is rarely seen anymore in today's NBA. The Kentucky big is averaging 25.1 points and 12.2 rebounds per game this season. Towns was arguably one of the biggest All-Star snubs of the season, and he has also flown under the radar with a lot of the national media. However, Towns has the brightest future of any young player in the league as he is putting up All-Star numbers as a second year player.</p>
