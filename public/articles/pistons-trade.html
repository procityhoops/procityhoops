<h1>Detroit Pistons interested in a trade?</h1>
<p>The Detroit Pistons missed out on the 2017 NBA Playoffs one year after being the eighth seed in 2016. The Pistons will pick 12th in the NBA Draft, but perhaps they may be looking for a veteran instead? On Tuesday, ESPNâ€™s Marc Stein reported that the Pistons are open to trading the 12th pick for a win-now veteran.</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine that the 12th pick would fetch a veteran capable of helping the Pistons win,  but, if the Pistons attach the pick to another pick or a young player, they may have better luck. It would probably be beneficial for the Pistons to trade their pick since they have not had much success drafting lately (Stanley Johnson and Henry Ellenson).</p>
