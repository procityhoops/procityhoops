<h1>Dallas Mavericks Free Agency Preview</h1>

<p>The Dallas Mavericks are one of the hardest teams to get a read on in the NBA. After making the playoffs in three consecutive seasons, the Mavericks finished 11th in the Western Conference with a 33-49 record last season. However, the Mavericks found some jewels during the 2016-2017 season. In his first season with the Mavericks, Seth Curry found his groove. He averaged 12.8 points per game on 42.5% shooting from beyond the arc. Yogi Ferrell also turned in a successful first season with the Mavericks. The rookie out of Indiana signed with Dallas halfway through the season and went on to average 11.3 points and 4.3 assists per game the rest of the way. The Mavericks also traded for big man Nerlens Noel from the Sixers at the NBA Trade Deadline last year. Noel averaged 8.5 points and 6.8 rebounds per game for the Mavericks while playing just 22 minutes a night. Now, the Mavericks added a versatile point guard last Thursday in Dennis Smith Jr. through the NBA Draft, and they need to find a way to get Dirk Nowitzki one last playoff run.</p>

<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $34 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: Nerlens Noel<br>
Unrestricted: DeAndre Liggins, Dirk Nowitzki</p>
<p>The Dallas Mavericks will need to make sure they re-sign and match any offer Nerlens Noel gets in free agency. He will likely require a lot of money, but the Mavericks traded for him and see him as the center of the future for Dallas. Obviously, Dirk Nowitzki will be back with the team. Nowitzki is reaching the end of his career, but he still managed to average 14.2 points and 6.5 rebounds per game last season at the age of 38. Dirk Nowitzki has said that he wants to be able to make one last playoff run with the Mavs and finish his career only playing for the Mavs. As for DeAndre Liggins, the Mavs could bring him back on a small contract to fill out the roster, but he will likely spend time in the G-League next season. Liggins only played in one game for the Mavericks last season, and unless they need someone to finish filling out their roster, it’s likely that he will find a new home.</p>

<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Jrue Holiday, Zach Randolph</p>
<p>The Mavericks need free agents that can help them win immediately. Their biggest hole on their roster is at the point guard position. The Mavericks did draft Dennis Smith Jr. on Thursday night, but they will likely still want a veteran point guard leading the team next season. Jrue Holiday would provide just that. Holiday has had injury concerns in the past, but if he can put those behind him, he’s a top-ten point guard in the NBA. As for Zach Randolph, it’s about getting another physical big man down low to split minutes with Dirk Nowitzki. Randolph and Nowitzki are coming down to their last legs of their career, but they can both still give the Mavs 25-28 quality minutes of basketball a night. Randolph would also bring a toughness to a team that consists of Barnes, Curry, Nowitzki, Noel, and Ferrell. His toughness and dirty work would be greatly appreciated by Dallas.</p>
