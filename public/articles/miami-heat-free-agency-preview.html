<h1>Miami Heat Free Agency Preview</h1>

<p>On January 13th, 2017, the Miami Heat found themselves in a big hole. They had an 11-30 record. But, they went on an incredible streak to end the year, and they finished the season at 41-41. Unfortunately for the Heat, they didn’t make the playoffs, but the team didn’t hang their head. They knew that they accomplished great things in the second half of the 2016-2017 season. The Heat were led by Hassan Whiteside and Goran Dragic. Whiteside averaged 17 points, 14.1 rebounds, and 2.1 blocks per game for the Heat while playing in 77 games. The points and rebound averages were career highs for Whiteside. Dragic averaged 20.3 points and 5.8 assists per game while playing 33.7 minutes per game. The two players led the charge for the Heat to get back in the playoff chase, but they were not alone. Dion Waiters, James Johnson, and Tyler Johnson were also a vital part of the Miami Heat’s success in the second half of last season. The Heat selected Edrice “Bam” Adebayo with the 14th pick in last Thursday’s NBA Draft, and they will now try to add more depth to put together a playoff run in the 2017-2018 season.</p>

<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $38 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: None<br>
Unrestricted: Luke Babbitt, Udonis Haslem, James Johnson, Willie Reed, and Dion Waiters</p>
<p>Before the Heat go and fully jump into the free agent market, they will have to make some decisions on their own players. Dion Waiters, James Johnson, and Willie Reed were all big contributors for the Heat last season. Waiters turned in a career year averaging 15.8 points per game while shooting 39.5% from beyond the arc. James Johnson also turned in the best season of his career. He averaged 12.8 points and 4.9 rebounds per game while playing 27.4 minutes per game. Then, Willie Reed, on a minimum-level contract, averaged 5.3 points and 4.7 rebounds per game in just 14.5 minutes per night. It’s safe to say that Willie Reed is done with the minimum-level contract life. As for Luke Babbitt, he started over half the games for the Heat last season. He didn’t contribute much in terms of stats, but he was able to space the floor for the Miami offense. Udonis Haslem only played in 16 games last season, and his NBA career is likely coming to a close. The Heat should do whatever it takes to keep Waiters, Johnson, and Reed around, but if they are focused on getting a top-tier free agent, it might not be possible to retain all their players.</p>

<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Gordon Hayward, Paul Millsap</p>
<p>The Miami Heat have been a free agent destination for a number of years. They seem to aim high every summer, and they usually don’t come away empty-handed. This summer the Heat should pursue Gordon Hayward and Paul Millsap. The Heat are projected to have enough cap to chase these guys, and there have been reports that these players would listen to the Heat’s pitch. Hayward has also been linked to Boston, but he would fit in very nicely alongside Hassan Whiteside and Goran Dragic in Miami. Paul Millsap would also be a great fit in Miami. Millsap could slide in next to Hassan Whiteside and take some pressure off of Whiteside. Millsap could stretch the floor, and he would allow some other Heat players to take their talents to the bench and provide depth there.</p>
