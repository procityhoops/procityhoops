<h1>The NBA is Back</h1>

<p>The sound of glasses clinking together at a bar. Folks screaming at the television. Facebook and Twitter debates about who is the best player. Arenas across the nation filled with rabid fans, eating hot dogs and drinking beer, wearing different types of basketball jerseys like myself, going hoarse while rooting for my team.</p>

<p>The NBA is back folks.</p>

<p>In spite of Kevin Durant going to the Golden State Warriors, competitively ruining last season, the association has made an implausible bounce back bigger than Big Sean could ever imagine. Last season, the league was devoid of competition as we all knew who the final two teams standing would be, and who would be crowned champion. Fans across the league were disappointed and angry, knowing that our insatiable appetite for competitive basketball had been all but extinguished with the big Durant move.</p>

<p>What has placated that sentiment however is the infusion of new talent that teams (Houston Rockets, Oklahoma City Thunder, Cleveland Cavaliers, Boston Celtics) have put together in response to last season. Consolidate that along with dominant stars simply not willing to settle this season (Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard), and teams, who if equipped with ample health and luck, can make a legitimate push for the throne (Toronto Raptors, San Antonio Spurs). According to Newton’s third law, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Science cannot be debated, and it is irrefutable that that has transpired this season.</p>

<p>The best sports league in the entire world (change my mind) for the last three years has held the title of the most predictable sports league in the entire world. The most interesting thing has been the MVP debate. Outside of that, it’s been about as foreseeable as the Instagram "models" on your timeline.</p>

<p>The Warriors are still the betting favorites. That’s something we should all agree on. However, let’s talk about the top four teams who are most equipped to topple the Warriors.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Boston Celtics (1-1 against Warriors)</b></h4>
<p>The C’s have put together a phenomenal season under that dude Kyrie Irving. It hurts my heart and agonizes my soul to see him slip out of Cleveland like that, but the dude is so likeable, I can’t help but watch him. Both games have been close this season. Boston won the game at home back in November, with the Dubs exacting revenge in January. Warriors have a better team, but Boston is nothing to play with. Kyrie is the ultimate clutch card, and the motley crew of Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, and Al Horford are a tough bunch for anyone to beat. They kind of remind me of a young Warriors squad pre Steve Kerr. The Celtics currently are the #1 ranked defense in the league, and Marcus Smart reminds me of Draymond Green. Speaking of those two, remember when Draymond was the first linebacker in the NBA?</p>

<h4><b>San Antonio (0-3 against Warriors)</b></h4>
<p>The Spurs strangely pose a huge threat to the Warriors. Credit Coach Popovich if you want. The record against the Dubs this season has simply been abysmal, but they have largely been without their best player, Kawhi Leonard. I firmly believe that if he hadn’t got injured in the first game of last year’s Western Conference Finals, then they could have at least pushed the Warriors to seven games. They were up by 25 before Leonard was injured, and the Warriors subsequently stormed back to a victory. This year is slightly different. LaMarcus Aldridge is happy. Kyle Anderson has averaged 16 points, 8 rebounds, and 4 assists against the Dubs this season. Insert Kawhi and that spells trouble. If there is one underdog that teams should always worry about, it’s this one. Just ask the 2012-2014 Miami Heat.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Cleveland (0-2 against Warriors)</b></h4>
<p>LeBron James.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Houston (2-1 against Warriors)</b></h4>
<p>The Houston Rockets have put together a season that is undeniably phenomenal. None of us expected THIS to happen when Chris Paul came to join Houston, but this iconoclastic team wants the Warriors. James Harden is the most dangerous isolation player in the game (averaging 1.24 points per play when finishing at least two possessions per game out of isolation). Chris Paul is one the best point guards of all-time, and the Rockets have the 2nd and 10th best offensive and defensive ranking respectively. Numbers don’t lie, and that is why they have the best chance to knock off the champs this year.</p>
