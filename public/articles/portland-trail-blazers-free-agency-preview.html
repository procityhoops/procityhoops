<h1>Portland Trail Blazers Free Agency Preview</h1>

<p>The Portland Trail Blazers had an up-and-down 2016-2017 season. They barely snuck into the playoffs as the eighth seed and proceeded to get swept in the first round by the Golden State Warriors. They finished the season 41-41 and were led by Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum. The duo combined for 50 points per game and both players shot very well from three-point range. In addition to the Blazers’ backcourt, Jusuf Nurkic was a big contributor for the team when he came over in a trade from Denver. Nurkic averaged 15.2 points and 10.4 rebounds per game for the Blazers in the second half of last season. However, other than that core three, the Blazers didn’t get much production from their other starters or their bench. In last week’s NBA Draft, the Blazers traded up to get Gonzaga product, Zach Collins. Collins is a versatile big man who is a capable jump shooter, which is almost required in this day and age in the NBA. Now, the Blazers turn their attention to free agency where they will need to find help for Lillard and McCollum.</p>

<h4><b>Max Cap Space: -$34 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: None<br>
Unrestricted: None</p>
<p>The Portland Trail Blazers have no free agents this offseason and have a full roster under contract going into next season. If the Blazers move some players, they could open up space and room for a free agent or two.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Shelvin Mack, David West</p>
<p>As it was just alluded to, the Portland Trail Blazers don’t have any cap or roster room this offseason. They could move some pieces and add some roster room, but otherwise, they can waive guys and add cheap contracts. Shelvin Mack and David West would both accept cheap contracts and contribute to the Blazers’ bench. In Mack, the Blazers would be getting a defense-first guard who can still contribute when Damian Lillard goes and takes a break. Mack is coming off a solid year for Utah, but he will likely not get much money this offseason because of the strong point guard market. In the 2017 NBA Playoffs, David West got his championship. Now, he can relax and play more minutes while still being on a competitive team. West would provide defensive toughness to the Blazers, which they sorely need off their bench. While both players wouldn’t play a lot of minutes, they could provide help to the Blazers’ bench and allow Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum to get a rest.</p>
