<h1>New Orleans Pelicans Free Agency Preview</h1>

<p>Ever since the Pelicans made the playoffs in the 2014-2015 season, they have gone nowhere but down. The Pelicans finished the 2016-2017 season with a 34-48 record, putting them tenth in the Western Conference. The Pelicans traded for star center DeMarcus Cousins at the trade deadline last season, but there wasn’t enough time in the rest of the season for the team to figure it out. Cousins averaged 24.4 points and 12.5 rebounds per game in his little time spent with the Pelicans last year. His teammate, Anthony Davis, averaged 28 points and 11.8 rebounds per game. Another key factor in the Pelicans little success last season was Jrue Holiday. Holiday averaged 15.4 points and 7.3 assists per game for New Orleans last season. He is an unrestricted free agent this offseason, and the Pelicans should do whatever it takes to keep him around. The duo of Cousins and Davis will be back with better chemistry next year, and that alone should provide better results. However, what can the Pelicans do in free agency to further improve their record?</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $13 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: None<br>
Unrestricted: Dante Cunningham, Jrue Holiday, and Donatas Motiejunas</p>
<p>The Pelicans have a big name hitting free agency this offseason. Jrue Holiday is set to be an unrestricted free agent, and the Pelicans need to do whatever it takes to retain him. Holiday had a terrific year for New Orleans last season, and he is just 27 years old. Holiday might demand a max contract, but for the Pelicans to win in the West, they will need a high-quality point guard to lead them. The Pelicans may also choose to bring back Dante Cunningham who gave the Pelicans some solid minutes last season. If they can get him back on a cheap contract, he would be a great option to bring off the bench. On the flip side, Donatas Motiejunas will likely not be back with the team next season. He didn’t play very many minutes for the Pelicans last season, and he can find more minutes elsewhere.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Kyle Korver, Ian Clark</p>
<p>The Pelicans need players who can space the floor, especially since they have two dominant big men. Kyle Korver and Ian Clark can both space the floor, and they won’t cost the Pelicans too much money. Korver hit 45.1% of his threes last season, and Ian Clark hit 37.4% of his attempts from deep. Obviously, Korver is a better shooter, but Ian Clark is still a young and improving player. Clark is just 26 years old, and if he’s given more minutes, he could blossom into a solid NBA talent.</p>
