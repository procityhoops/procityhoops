<h1>Minnesota Timberwolves Free Agency Preview</h1>

<p>The Minnesota Timberwolves finished the 2016-2017 season with a record of 31-51, putting them 13th in the Western Conference. The Wolves only improved by two wins from the previous season, but their young guys put up terrific numbers. Karl-Anthony Towns led the way averaging 25.1 points and 12.3 rebounds per game. Andrew Wiggins also turned in a solid third season in the NBA averaging 23.6 points per game and shooting 35.6% from three-point range, a career high. Zach Lavine was also on pace for a career year before tearing his ACL. Of course, Lavine is now a member of the Chicago Bulls since he was in the trade package for the Wolves to acquire Jimmy Butler. Another big part of the Wolves team in the 2016-2017 season was Ricky Rubio. Rubio averaged 11.1 points and 9.1 assists per game for the Wolves which were both career highs. In addition, Rubio had a tough start to the beginning of the season last year, but he came on strong after the All-Star break to turn in his best season as a pro. Now, the Wolves have acquired All-Star Jimmy Butler, and they need to turn in a successful free agency to get back to where they haven’t been since the 2003-2004 season: the playoffs.</p>

<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $20 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: Shabazz Muhammad<br>
Unrestricted: Brandon Rush, Adreian Payne, and Omri Casspi</p>
<p>The Timberwolves will have to let their unrestricted free agents walk in order to reach max cap space. Brandon Rush didn’t have the season that many thought he would going into his first season with the Wolves, so it’s likely he will not be back with the team next season. Adreian Payne has been horrendous for the Wolves for years, and he will likely find a spot in the G-League with a different team. The Wolves could re-sign Omri Casspi if they are still looking for shooting later in free agency, but he won’t be a priority on July 1st. Shabazz Muhammad is the Wolves biggest free agent. Muhammad averaged 9.9 points per game in 19.4 minutes off the bench a night. Shabazz will likely sign a big offer sheet elsewhere, and the Wolves won’t be able to match because they will want to use their cap on a different player. Tom Thibodeau has said he would love to have Muhammad back, but he won’t use their entire cap space on him.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Paul Millsap, J.J. Redick</p>
<p>After trading for Jimmy Butler, the Minnesota Timberwolves will look to make a splash during the offseason. They have been linked to guys like Kyle Lowry and Jrue Holiday, but that’s not what they really need. Paul Millsap would be able to slide in at the power forward position and dominate next to Karl-Anthony Towns. It would also allow Gorgui Dieng to slide into a bench role. Millsap would demand a lot of money, but the Wolves would be getting an All-Star caliber player to pair next to Karl-Anthony Towns. J.J. Redick would be able to help the Wolves bench and step into a starting role if someone went down with an injury. Redick would be a very good weapon off the bench and would benefit from extra shots on an otherwise poor Wolves bench.</p>
