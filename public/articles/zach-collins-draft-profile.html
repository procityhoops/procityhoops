<p>Zach Collins was a freshman at Gonzaga in the 2016-2017 college season, and he helped lead the Zags a National Championship appearance. Measuring at 7’0” and weighing in at 230 pounds, Collins has terrific size and will be able to play the four or five at the NBA level. Collins has terrific potential on both ends of the floor and is considered a top-tier big man in the draft.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Strengths</b></h4>
<p>As previously alluded to, Zach Collins has terrific size and agility for a rookie coming into the league. Collins uses his size to stay with bigger players on the post and to go to work when he’s guarded by a smaller opponent. In his freshman season at Gonzaga, Collins showed he could finish well in the post. He converted around 70% of his chances around the rim. He got 128 post-up possessions, and he averaged 1.13 points per possession on those post-ups. Collins only played 17.3 minutes per game for Gonzaga, but in that time, he averaged 10.0 points, 5.9 rebounds, and 1.8 blocks per game. Those numbers come out to 23.2 points, 13.6 rebounds, and 4.1 blocks per 40 minutes. The points and rebounds per 40 minutes surpass those of Karl-Anthony Towns’ freshman season at Kentucky. While Collins is a polished player in the post, he also has the potential to be a stretch four in the NBA. Collins only attempted 21 threes last year at Gonzaga, but he hit on ten of them (47.6%). Collins has a smooth form that should allow him to progress his three-point shot. Going back to Karl-Anthony Towns, he only shot eight threes in his lone season at Kentucky. Last season for the Wolves, Towns shot 275 threes and hit on 36.7% of them. So, if Collins works hard in the gym, the ability to stretch the floor is there.</p>
<p>Collins is also a terrific rebounder. He would have grabbed 13.6 rebounds per game if he would have played 40 minutes. Collins focuses on getting good position down low, which he needs because he doesn’t have particularly good length. His size allows him to box out his opponent and come down with the rebound. While he was on the floor for Gonzaga last season, Collins grabbed 18.3% of all available rebounds. He also has a great mind and a high basketball IQ. Collins can close on defenders very quickly and is a very good pick-and-roll defender. Collins can switch on to a smaller guard and still contain him very well for his size. He can also show defense on the guard and get back to his man before his matchup has a chance to get a shot off. The potential that Collins has not only on the offensive end but also the defensive end is astonishing.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Weaknesses</b></h4>
<p>Although Zach Collins has size, he lacks physicality and strength. Collins seemed to shy away from contact in his freshman season at Gonzaga. He didn’t love being physical with opposing centers, and if Collins wants to survive in the NBA, he will need to adapt this into his game. Centers and power forwards in the NBA like to get physical, and Collins will get shredded if he doesn’t return the favor. Another big concern for Collins is his polish on the offensive side of the ball. Collins needs space to get off his jumper and isn’t the greatest at driving to the hoop. Of course, Collins is just 19 years old, and as he grows older, he will become more polished.</p>
<p>Another concern in Collins’ game is the foul trouble he could get into. Collins averaged 2.7 fouls in his freshman season at Gonzaga, but he only played 17.3 minutes per game. A big reason for this is because Collins doesn’t like to be physical. When an opponent gets physical with him, he gets chippy and often commits silly fouls. The foul trouble will need to be addressed by being willing to be more physical and his fouls will go down. Zach Collins has a decent amount of weaknesses, but all of them will be able to be addressed and can be pretty easy fixes. Collins won’t be a guy that will be NBA ready from the start, but his potential is through the roof.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>NBA Comparison</b></h4>
<p>Richaun Holmes. Although Richaun Holmes is still young, his game matches up very well with Collins’. Like Holmes, Zach Collins will take some time to develop in the NBA. In Holmes’ first season in the NBA, he only played 13.8 minutes per game in 51 appearances. Collins will likely go down the same path and get time to develop an NBA repertoire. If everything goes according to plan, Zach Collins has a ceiling of Karl-Anthony Towns, but the most realistic comparison is Richaun Holmes.</p>
