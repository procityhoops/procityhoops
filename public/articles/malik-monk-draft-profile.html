<h1>Malik Monk Draft Profile</h1>

<p>A SEC All-Conference first team honoree, Malik Monk has been flying under the radar over the recent months. Malik Monk was the talk of college basketball at the beginning of the season, and after his 47-point performance against North Carolina in the middle of December, Monk was drawing top-5 pick comparisons. Now, many mock drafts have Monk going anywhere from pick #6 to pick #8, which isn’t far off from five, but after such a hot star, why did he drop off? The main reason for Monk’s slight fall is his teammate, De’Aaron Fox. At the start of the season, Monk was the focal point of the Kentucky team, and towards the end of the year, Fox started to take control. Fans around the NBA and NCAA started to turn their attention to Fox and turn away and almost ignore Malik Monk. Although his spotlight was covered up at the end of his freshman season at Kentucky, Malik Monk is a can’t miss prospect in the 2017 NBA Draft.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Strengths</b></h4>
<p>Whenever someone looks at Malik Monk, the first thing they notice is his tremendous scoring ability. Monk averaged 19.8 points per game and shot 39.7% from three-point range. Monk has a very smooth jump shot that should transfer seamlessly to the NBA. Monk gets great elevation on his shot and that allows him to get off a shot at anytime and anywhere. While some may argue that his high jump on his jump shot may hurt him at the end of the game, Monk has great conditioning, and his jump shot looks the same at the beginning and the end of the game. At the preseason showcase for Kentucky, Malik Monk showed off a terrific 42-inch vertical. With that unbelievable vertical comes extreme explosiveness. His explosiveness allows him to get by a defender with ease and finish at the rim off of one or two feet. His explosiveness also allows him to defend quicker guards. He doesn’t have great size at the shooting guard position, but his quickness allows him to stick with guards on the drive.</p>
<p>Another underrated part of Monk’s game is his passing ability. Monk has the ability to drive and kick when the defense crashes down on him in the lane. Per 40 minutes in his freshman season at Kentucky, Monk averaged 2.9 assists per game. While those numbers don’t jump off paper, remember that Monk wasn’t the primary ball-handler on Kentucky. Monk will be better off as a two-guard in the NBA, but if he is given the opportunity to handle the ball, he is capable of averaging six or seven assists a night. One of the final strengths of Malik Monk is his work ethic. Coaches at Kentucky raved about his work ethic and his communication with his teammates. Whatever team gets Malik Monk, it’s clear that he will be a tremendous fit in the locker room, and he will work as hard as possible to become the best player possible.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Weaknesses</b></h4>
<p>Malik Monk’s main weaknesses come with his body frame. Malik Monk only stands 6’3” and weighs a slim, 201 lbs. His body frame gives him trouble on the defensive end of the court. Monk doesn’t stand a chance if a bigger guard is able to get him in the post and back him down. Monk has time to gain some muscle, which he will need if he wants to guard elite two’s in the NBA. Another concern in Monk’s game is his shooting decisions. Monk likes to take a lot of “heat checks” throughout the course of the game, and they hurt his team. Monk will need to learn how to channel and control his urge to shoot tightly contested shots. If Monk can do this, he will have a much better shooting percentage and his team will get much better offensive results.</p>
<p>Given his explosive athleticism, Malik Monk should be rebounding at a much higher rate. For a guy with a 42-inch vertical, grabbing only 3.1 rebounds per 40 minutes is unacceptable. However, in the NBA, Monk should rebound at a much higher rate. Kentucky liked to send Malik Monk out in transition on the wing for a chance at an open three, which NBA teams might do too, but not as often as John Calipari did. Much like many of the other top prospects in the 2017 NBA Draft, almost all of Monk’s weaknesses are fixable. A lot of his weakness just involve his mindset, and when he arrives in an NBA locker room, that will change.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>NBA Comparison</b></h4>
<p>Lou Williams. Malik Monk has a chance to be a star in the NBA, but a Lou Williams comparison is all too obvious. Both players have the ability to create their own shot and score at will. Much like Lou Williams, Malik Monk will likely start on the bench and provide an offensive punch for his team. A best case scenario for Malik Monk would be C.J. McCollum. McCollum is a top-five shooting guard in the NBA, and if Monk keeps working hard, he can get to that point too.</p>
