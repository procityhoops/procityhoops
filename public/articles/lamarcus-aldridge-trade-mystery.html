<h1>The LaMarcus Aldridge Trade Mystery</h1>

<p>The date was Tuesday, January 4, 2011. The Portland Trail Blazers had just lost a close game in American Airlines Center, home of the Dallas Mavericks, and Blazers star LaMarcus Aldridge was sitting with his head down in front of his locker in the closet that serves as the visitors' locker room. Having known Aldridge for quite some time, I sat down next to him and asked how he was doing. Despite having just turned in a brilliant game - 28 points and 10 rebounds - Aldridge was not happy. The team, which was supposed to be built around Brandon Roy, Greg Oden and Aldridge, more or less in that order, was down two stars. Aldridge felt like he was just treading water waiting for his teammates to finally get healthy and he was frustrated that he wasn't getting any love in All-Star voting.</p>
<p>I was a little surprised, not so much by his frustration, but by the fact that no one had broken the news to him. The Blazers were not <i>ever</i> going to have Oden and Roy back at 100%, and if they were ever able to play at all it would be in supporting roles next to Aldridge. The Blazers, in other words, were now Aldridge's team, and the sooner he accepted that the sooner the Blazers could start turning things around . . .which in turn would get him the All-Star recognition he coveted.</p>
<p>Aldridge was very much in denial, insisting that the Blazers were still "Brandon's team," but Marcus Camby, who was dressing in the locker across the narrow aisle, leaned over, pointed at me, and said, "You better listen to this guy. This is <i>your</i> team now."</p>
<p>Despite his reluctance and his eagerness to concede the leadership role to someone else, Aldridge played extremely well, averaging career-bests of 21.8 points and 8.8 rebounds per game, and falling just short of the NBA's Most Improved Player award. He did not garner All-Star recognition that year, but he did the following season, when he emerged as the Blazers' clear leader.  His continued emergence made him a regular, as he represented the Blazers as an All-Star for the following three seasons before ultimately opting to succeed Tim Duncan and chase a title with the San Antonio Spurs.</p>
<p>San Antonio fans were overjoyed, feeling as though the Spurs had just landed the next Tim Duncan just as their all-time best franchise player retired. Unfortunately, just as his first legitimate championship shot came, Aldridge's tendency to defer kicked back in. Even as the Spurs hoped to make him the center of their offensive attack, Aldridge became passive, all too happy to let emerging star Kawhi Leonard shoulder the load. He averaged just 18.0 points and 8.0 rebounds per game - both well below the averages that got him All-Star recognition - in 2015-16 and 17.3 and 7.3, respectively, in 2016-17.</p>
<p>As the 2017 NBA Draft neared, word came out that Aldridge was unhappy with his role in San Antonio and the Spurs then attempted, unsuccessfully, to trade him for a lottery pick. Rumors abounded that the Spurs would use Aldridge in a trade to land one of free agency's biggest names, but as of this writing the union between the Spurs and Aldridge is still intact.</p>
<p>So where does that leave things?</p>
<p>The best-case scenario for the Spurs, who have added Rudy Gay to the mix now, is for Aldridge to have another come-to-Jesus with himself and fire up the engine that helped Portland become a playoff team again and made him a perennial All-Star. If that were to happen, there is little doubt that the Spurs could give the defending champion Golden State Warriors a run for their money. After all, they just made it to the Western Conference Finals with Leonard and starting point guard Tony Parker out of action. Aldridge scorched the Houston Rockets for 34 points on 62% shooting in the Spurs' most unlikely win of the season, the one that defeated Houston and sent San Antonio to the WCF. He then dropped 28 on the Warriors in Game 1 of the WCF, a game in which the undefeated Warriors needed a momentous comeback to steal a 113-11 win. Again, the Spurs were without two starters for that affair, including the reigning Defensive Player of the Year in Leonard.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Spurs, Aldridge all but disappeared for the rest of the series, posting two games in which he only managed eight points as the Spurs were blown out in three consecutive contests.</p>
<p>Is it true that LaMarcus Aldridge is unhappy with his role in San Antonio? Really? There are a great many players in the NBA who would love to be in his position. He's playing for Gregg Popovich, who might just be the best coach of all time, in a city sells out its arena every night with some of the most passionate fans in the world. What's more, he's playing for a team that has had unprecedented success over three decades despite the decline and retirement of multiple Hall of Fame players. If there is a sweet spot in the NBA year in and year out, it's in San Antonio.</p>
<p>What's not to like???</p>
<p>The truth is, it's time for LaMarcus Aldridge to decide what he wants his legacy to be. Does he want to be remembered as one of many very good players who hung around the NBA for a while, or does he want to be remembered as an all-time great who was an indispensable member of an elite team? If Aldridge can once again do some soul-searching and find the player who led Portland back to relevance and became a perennial All-Star, he could be a key part of unseating the Warriors as the undisputed (hardly even challenged) best basketball team in the world.</p>
<p>If he can't - and if he continues to allow the perception to be that he is unhappy with his role in San Antonio - he might just find himself in the middle of some team's cycle of perennial rebuilding.</p>
