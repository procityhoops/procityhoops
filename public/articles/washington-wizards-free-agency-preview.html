<p>The Washington Wizards finally had their breakout year in the 2016-2017 season. They finished with a 49-33 record and as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference. While their playoff run was stopped short by Boston in the second round, their core players gained valuable postseason experience. John Wall led their team the whole year averaging 23.1 points, 10.7 assists, and 4.3 rebounds per game in 78 games. While Washington finally got the productivity they were waiting for from John Wall, shooting guard Bradley Beal was the story of the year. Beal averaged 23.1 points, 3.5 assists, and 3.1 rebounds per game. While his offensive numbers were impressive, what was even more surprising about Beal was that he played in 77 games this year. With most of his early career riddled with injuries, Beal stayed healthy all season and played a crucial role in the Wizards success. While Washington is still a little ways away from competing with LeBron and co. in Cleveland, their biggest competitor right now is Boston. This year’s offseason may be one of the most important to the Wizards in the past 15 years.</p>

<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $3 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: Otto Porter, Bojan Bogdanovic<br>
Unrestricted: Brandon Jennings, Trey Burke </p>
<p>The Wizards don’t have a lot of room to make big moves this offseason. While it would be nice for them to sign a free agent big man, it seems unlikely that they can afford a top-tier player. The Wizards key in free agency is to retain Otto Porter. Averaging over 13 points and 6 rebounds per game, Porter proved he is capable of being the Wizards starting small forward for years to come. If they can keep his salary within means, Bogdanovic is becoming a valuable bench player that the Wizards should try their hardest to retain. Brandon Jennings and Trey Burke should be let go as neither of them really provide anything of value to the team.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Willie Reed, Sergio Rodriguez</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Wizards don’t really have a lot of room to operate this offseason. The first target for Washington is Willie Reed. Reed should be a fairly affordable option and would fit the hole for a big off the bench in Washington. Reed played decent for the Heat last season but does have a player option, so he would have to waive that for the Wizards to have a chance. The next target is Sergio Rodriguez. Rodriguez played for the 76ers this past season and didn’t exactly light it up. He would be an affordable option at point guard and would be able to come off the bench and distribute.</p>
