<h1>Eric Bledsoe on the move?</h1>
<p>The Phoenix Suns fell two spots in the NBA Draft Lottery and will now select at pick four. With young guard Devin Booker leading the Suns last season, Phoenix will be looking to boost their young talent again this year. Eric Bledsoe is one name to watch in trade talks, however, Steve Kyler of Basketball Insiders has said the Suns have no interest in dealing Bledsoe. Tyler Ulis played well in Bledsoeâ€™s absence at the end of last year and, if Bledsoe was dealt, Ulis would continue to develop. If the Suns are bluffing, the Detroit Pistons are a team to keep an eye on. The Pistons are rumored to have an interest in a veteran that could help them win now, and the twelfth pick in the draft would not be a bad return for Bledsoe.</p>
