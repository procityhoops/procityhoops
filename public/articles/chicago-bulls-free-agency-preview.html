<h1>Chicago Bulls Free Agency Preview</h1>

<p>What a season for the Chicago Bulls. A season full of ups and downs, capped off by a playoff appearance. The Chicago Bulls finished the 2016-2017 NBA season with a 41-41 record which rewarded them with the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference. The Bulls had a 2-0 lead on the Celtics in the first round of the playoffs, but then Rajon Rondo went down with an injury, and the Bulls lost four straight. The Bulls were led by Jimmy Butler the entire season. Butler averaged 23.9 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game last season. However, during the 2017 NBA Draft, the Bulls shipped Butler and Justin Patton to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Zach Lavine, Kris Dunn, and Lauri Markkanen. On Tuesday morning, John Paxson and Gar Forman described the change as “choosing a direction.” The Bulls chose to rebuild, and now, they need to reflect that during the free agency period.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $40 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: Cristiano Felicio, Joffrey Lauvergne, and Nikola Mirotic<br>
Unrestricted: Anthony Morrow</p>
<p>The Chicago Bulls have the potential to be set up very well in free agency. They chose not to extend the qualifying offer to Michael Carter-Williams late on Tuesday which will offer the team more cap space. The Bulls biggest name hitting the free agent market is Nikola Mirotic. Mirotic averaged 10.6 points and 5.5 rebounds per game last season for the Bulls. Mirotic is still young (26 years old), and he still deserves a chance on the Bulls. Mirotic can start or come off the bench and stretch the floor. He perfectly describes the direction of the NBA: a 6’10” power forward with range. The Bulls also have Cristiano Felicio and Joffrey Lauvergne hitting restricted free agency. Both players are young, and if the Bulls can get them back on cheap deals, it would be worth getting another look at them. As far as Anthony Morrow is concerned, he will likely not be back. The Bulls will need veteran guys to lead their young team, but Morrow can still contribute and shoot the ball on a contending team.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Mason Plumlee, Tony Snell</p>
<p>Both free agent targets for the Chicago Bulls are restricted free agents. This is okay because the Bulls are rebuilding and aren’t focused on winning next year. So, if they strike out in free agency this year, there’s always next year. Mason Plumlee would give the Bulls a young center to add to their already young core. Plumlee would take a lot of money to get away from the Nuggets, but pairing him with Zach Lavine and Kris Dunn would be beneficial. Tony Snell is a three and D type player. He does whatever the team asks him to do. He could benefit big time in Chicago where there would be minutes to be had. While both targets would be hard to pry away from their current teams, it’s a risk worth taking if you’re Chicago.</p>
