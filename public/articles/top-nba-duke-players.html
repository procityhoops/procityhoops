<p>Each week, for the next month or so, there will be a focus on a certain college basketball powerhouse. A powerhouse that not only has success at the college ranks, but also at the professional level. This week’s focus will be the <b>Duke University Blue Devils</b>.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Duke Blue Devils:</b></h4>
<p>• 5 National Championships (1991, 1992, 2001, 2010, 2015)<br>
• 16 Final Fours <br>
• 41 ACC Tournament Championships/24 Regular Season Championships <br>
• Players currently in the NBA: 24 (2 free agents) 
</p>
<p>Mike Kryzyzewski is arguably the greatest college basketball coach of all-time right up there with John Wooden. What he has done in his tenure at Duke is nothing short of remarkable. Just when the media and fans think Duke is falling off, they go out and win another title. Let’s talk about the TOP five Duke players in the NBA right now:</p>
<br> 
<h4><b>1. Kyrie Irving (Boston Celtics)</b></h4>
<p>• #1 pick in the 2011 NBA Draft by Cleveland Cavaliers <br>
• One and done at Duke <br>
• NBA Rookie of the Year <br>
• NBA Champion (2016 with Cleveland) <br>
• 4x NBA All-Star (2013, 2014, 2015, 2017) <br>
• Signed a five-year, $90 million contract extension with Cleveland in 2014<br>
• Traded to the Boston Celtics for Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic and the Brooklyn Nets 2018 unprotected first round draft pick
</p>
<p>What more can be said about Irving? This kid, who hasn’t even entered his prime yet, has already accomplished more in six years than most players do in their entire career. Irving hit one of the biggest shots in NBA Finals history, nailing the game-winning three-pointer over Stephen Curry to secure Cleveland’s first championship in 2016. While at Duke, Kyrie only played 11 games due to a toe injury and averaged 17.5 PPG, 3.4 RPG, and 4.3 APG. He averaged 21.6 PPG, 3.4 RPG, and 5.5 APG during his time in Cleveland, and those numbers will certainly increase with Boston. A new chapter is being written for Kyrie. He was traded to Boston in a mega deal at the end of the summer and is now in position to lead his team, unlike in Cleveland, because the leader was LeBron James. It is questionable why Kyrie would want to leave LeBron and the Cavs, but everybody has their reasons. It will take some time getting used to Kyrie in green, but a new era of basketball is here. All eyes will be on Kyrie Irving during the 2017-2018 season.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>2. J.J. Redick (Philadelphia 76ers)</b></h4>
<p>• #11 pick in 2006 NBA Draft by Orlando Magic<br>
• Four year player at Duke from 2002-2006<br>
• National College Player of the Year (2006) <br>
• 2x Consensus first-team All-American<br>
• 2x ACC Player of the Year<br>
• 2x ACC Tournament MVP<br>
• No. 4 retired by Duke<br>
• Signed a one-year, $23 million contract with Philadelphia in the 2017 offseason
</p>
<p>J.J. Redick is a very underrated player in my opinion, and probably for most. Coming out of college, he was the best player in the nation and everyone thought he would go on to have a great NBA career, and they were right. Although it took Redick a while to get adjusted to the fast-paced style of the NBA, when he figured it out he developed himself in to one of the deadliest three-point shooters in the league. Set a screen for him and he’s one of the best catch and shoot players not only today, but also in the history of the game. Redick played for the Magic, Bucks, most recently with the Clippers, and now with the 76ers. He will join a very young team with big aspirations and hopes to be that veteran every team needs. Look for the 76ers to improve and J.J. will be a big part of that. Redick averaged 19.9 PPG, 2.7 RPG, and 2.2 APG while at Duke and his NBA career averages are 11.9 PPG, 1.9 RPG, and 1.8 APG.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>3. Jabari Parker (Milwaukee Bucks)</b></h4>
<p>• #2 pick in the 2014 NBA Draft<br>
• One and done at Duke <br>
• Consensus first-team All-American <br>
• Still on rookie contract
</p>
<p>Now I know what you’re thinking. How can a guy with two ACL tears be on this list? Aside from the injuries, while on the court, Parker has been a very effective player and was developing himself into a big role player before having his second ACL tear in the same knee in the last three seasons. Parker averaged 19.1 PPG, 8.7 RPG, and 1.2 APG at Duke. I have him high on this list because Parker still has potential; he just has to stay healthy. He has the work ethic and the drive to become a great player in this league, but is one major injury away from being another Derrick Rose. Here is to hoping Parker will come back stronger than ever and lead the Bucks alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo. If he stays healthy with an improved Giannis, look out for the Bucks. </p>

<h4><b>4. Mason Plumlee (Denver Nuggets)</b></h4>
<p>• #22 pick in the 2013 NBA Draft by Brooklyn Nets<br>
• Four-year player at Duke from 2009-2013<br>
• Consensus second-team All-American<br>
• NCAA Champion in 2009
</p>
<p>You might wonder why Mason Plumlee is on this list. He is for a very good reason, and if you don’t think so, you don’t know basketball. Plumlee has surprised everybody with his play during his four short years in the NBA. He averaged 9.8 PPG, 7.7 RPB, and 1.5 APG. In the NBA, he has averaged 9 PPG, 6.5 RPG, and 2 APG. I know those aren’t gaudy numbers, but his impact on the basketball court goes a long way. He’s athletic, can rebound, run the floor, and his passing has improved immensely in the league. Now that Plumlee was traded to the Nuggets for Jusuf Nurkic back in February, he will have a chance to start a new chapter in Denver, who are looking to get back into the playoffs. They have a very nice young core with Mudiay, Murray, and Harris so do not be surprised to see Denver in the playoffs this season.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>5. Brandon Ingram</b></h4>
<p>• #2 pick in the 2016 NBA Draft by Los Angeles Lakers <br>
• One and done at Duke <br>
• ACC Rookie of the Year <br>
• Second-team All-ACC<br>
• Still on rookie contract  
</p>
<p>Ingram is a toss up. There are a couple other players that can take this spot like Jahlil Okafor or Austin Rivers, but Ingram might be first on this list in a few years. At Duke, he averaged 17.3 PPG, 6.8 RPG, and 2 APG. His rookie season in the NBA saw him average 9.4 PPG, 4 RPG, and 2.1 APG. With his Kevin Durant-like frame his potential is through the roof, and once he has put it all together, watch out. The Lakers have a young core they can expect to bring them back to the playoffs in the few years. Time can only tell. Ingram’s future is certainly bright, and so is LA’s. </p>
<p>That concludes the second edition of University Pros on ProCity Hoops. Next week will feature another college basketball powerhouse, the University of North Carolina.</p>
