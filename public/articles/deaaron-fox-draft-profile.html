<h1>De'Aaron Fox Draft Profile</h1>

<h4><b>Strengths</b></h4>
<p>De’Aaron Fox is hands down the fastest player in the draft. Fox’s ability to get up and down the court in transition is very similar to another former Wildcat, John Wall. Fox’s ability to grab the rebound and get up the court should translate well to the NBA which could have a major impact on his teammates at the next level. In addition to blistering speed, Fox’s ability to run the pick-and-roll and create not only for himself but his teammates is a major strength that he possesses.</p>
<p>On top of the physical attributes, Fox has shown a knack for playing well in the biggest games of the season. Exhibit A being his 39-point outburst in a sweet 16 game this past season against fellow top-five pick, Lonzo Ball. While Fox poured in 39 points on the offensive end, the most impressive part about that performance was the defense he played on Lonzo Ball, limiting him to 10 points and 8 assists while also forcing four turnovers. Fox’s defensive dominance should continue to develop once he enters the NBA and further develops his 6’4” frame.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Weaknesses</b></h4>
<p>Fox’s biggest weakness entering the NBA draft is his shooting. Fox shot less than 25% from three this past season. While Fox was effective getting to the rim, his struggles from outside the paint caused his overall field goal percentage to drop under 50%. While shooting can be taught, the way the league is trending means that ball dominant guards have to be able to not only be willing to shoot but also able to hit from outside the paint and the three-point line.</p>
<p>While Fox’s biggest weakness is his shot-making ability, he was also turnover prone in his only season at Kentucky. This is to be expected, not only from a freshman but also someone who has the ball is his hands as much as De’Aaron did. Fox’s speed causes many problems for the defense; however, his speed can hinder his passing ability at times.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>NBA Comparison</b></h4>
<p>John Wall / Derrick Rose hybrid. While this may seem like a lazy comparison given the three all played for coach Calipari, Fox’s ability mirrors that of the former Kentucky point guards. Fox’s ability to get out in transition has not been seen in a prospect since John Wall came out in the 2010 NBA Draft. The same questions were raised about Wall’s shot coming out, but his above average free throw shooting gave Wizards fans hope. Fox shot 73% from the stripe this season which could prove a sign of things to come.</p>
<p>In addition to Wall’s transition ability, Fox uses his speed and athleticism to get to the rim much like Derrick Rose did before he fell victim to numerous knee injuries. As Fox’s jumper improves, look for the court to open up and allow him to get to the rim at will, ala Derrick Rose in Chicago.</p>
