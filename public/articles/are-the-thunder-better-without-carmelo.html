<h1>Are the Thunder better without Carmelo?</h1>

<p>The Oklahoma City Thunder sit in an interesting spot with four games to play in the 2018 NBA Regular Season. The Thunder currently hold the fifth seed in the Western Conference, half a game behind the Spurs, but also just one and a half games back of the eighth seed. Coming off of a historic season from Russell Westbrook in last year’s campaign, Thunder General Manager Sam Presti knew he had to find Westbrook some help in the offseason. And that is just what Presti did. The Thunder began the offseason by trading for former Pacers’ star, Paul George. George would have just one year left in his contract, but with the idea of Westbrook and George teaming up, Presti made the move he had to make. However, as the offseason was coming to a close, Presti made another big move adding Carmelo Anthony to the team. While OKC had to sacrifice Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Enes Kanter, and more for George and Anthony, with Russell Westbrook in the prime of his career, it were moves that Presti could not turn down.</p>
<p>Right when Anthony was acquired from the Knicks, fans around the NBA began to question if there would be enough shots to go around for the Thunder. The same was said about the Warriors when they signed Kevin Durant in the summer of 2016. The Warriors, of course, figured it out and went on to win the 2017 NBA Championship. When asked if the Anthony move was in any way a risk for the Thunder, Presti simply responded, “I don’t see it as much of a risk with the team we have in place.” Presti would go on and describe Melo as a “dynamic” player and believed that Billy Donovan would run the right sets to get the best out of Anthony. However, the way the season has gone for the Thunder makes a lot of NBA fans question if the Carmelo move was the right play for the Thunder.</p>
<p>In the 2017/18 NBA season, Carmelo Anthony is averaging career-lows in multiple statistical categories. First off, he is averaging 16.3 points per game, 4.5 points per game lower than his second-worst season in that category when he was in Denver. In addition, Anthony is shooting a career-low 40.6% from the field this season. That is his worst percentage from the field since his rookie season. There is an obvious explanation for the points per game drop off since he is now playing next to Russell Westbrook and Paul George, superstars in their own right. However, the field goal percentage should be much higher than what it is. With Westbrook collapsing the lane on drives to the basket, Anthony often finds himself open on the perimeter, but has not been able to knock the shots down consistently.</p>
<p>Even though Anthony is not having one of his best statistical seasons for the Thunder, that does not mean he is not valuable to the team. When Carmelo Anthony is on the floor this season, OKC has a 113.7 offensive rating. When he is on the bench, OKC’s offensive rating drops to 105.6, an 8.1 point difference. On the other hand, the Thunder are a better defensive team when Anthony is on the bench holding opponents to a 106.5 offensive rating with Melo sitting and allowing a 108.3 offensive rating when he is on the court.</p>
<p>The short answer to the question if the Thunder would be better off without Melo is “no.” The Thunder have shown promise this season picking up marquee wins against teams like the Rockets and Warriors. However, it is a little concerning that a team with as much talent as the Thunder have is sitting fifth in the Western Conference. The Thunder have time to improve their spot in the Western Conference, but they are in danger of being a low seed in the Western Conference with three high-caliber players in the league on their roster. Presti made the right moves in the offseason to acquire George, and additionally Anthony, the Thunder just need it all to come together. If they can hit a stride heading into the playoffs, the Thunder will be a very dangerous team come mid-April.</p>
