<h1>Phil Jackson: A Eulogy</h1>

<p> An 11 time world champion. One of the best coaches in the history of North American team sports. The man who led Michael Jordan, Dennis Rodman, Shaq, and Kobe Bryant to championship after championship. A sure-fire hall of fame coach, and deservedly so. However, at 71 years old, Phil Jackson has added one more superlative to his illustrious career - disgraced ex-president of the second worst sports franchise in New York sports history (Sorry Nets fans).</p>
<p>It's not about the 80-166 record under Jackson's leadership. Was it the worst record in the NBA over the last 3 seasons? No. Just the 5th worst. When you share a league with the 76ers, it's hard to be the absolute bottom of the barrel, but Phil sure came close. To put that in perspective, the Golden State Warriors had a 73 win single season in 2015/16, just seven less than Phil had in his three years in New York.</p>
<p>It's not about falling asleep during a top prospect's pre-draft workout. Has that drawn every armchair analyst ever out of the woodwork to claim that Phil got fired on purpose? Sure, but in conspiracy situations you need to consider Occam's Razor. It's much more likely that Phil is a tired and befuddled dinosaur than he is a four dimensional chess player.</p>
<p>It's not about his inexplicable desire to buy out Carmelo Anthony. Conventional knowledge (common sense) says that even if you have to lose someone like Melo, you can at least get something back. He was a 22.4 PPG player last season, shooting 43.3% from the field, but when you've got guys like Kristaps Porzingis on your roster, you can afford to lose a player with those numbers. You can afford to drop Derrick Rose (18 PPG, 47.1% FG) too.</p>
<p>Speaking of Porzingis, it's not even about that entire situation. Sure, Kristaps is a dominant, physical presence with a generally good attitude, but missing an exit meeting is unforgivable in the backwards gaze of Phil Jackson. Porzingis may very well be the only slight, slight glimmer of hope that the Knicks organization has, and a smart executive would be willing to set aside personal differences to keep a player of his caliber around. We're not talking about a smart executive. We're talking about Phil Jackson.</p>
<p>Phil Jackson is one of the best coaches in the history of basketball. That isn't up for debate. An 11 time world champion who helped shape dozens of top level, generational talents, and, at one time, an innovator - a chess player, the pioneer of what would become the gold standard for offense in the NBA for a decade. Unfortunately for Phil, that decade was over about 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Phil Jackson the coach is a certified legend, but Phil Jackson the team executive is a punchline. Phil mismanaged the Knicks at nearly every single opportunity he had. He was lazy, he was incompetent, but most importantly, he was antiquated. With each day that Phil talked about the Porzingis situation this offseason, it became increasingly clear that the game of basketball itself is something that Phil is no longer familiar with. The sleepy, ineffective and out of touch old man who you saw when you watched Knicks pressers seems worlds removed from the Zen Master who coached Michael Jordan.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Phil proved himself to be the worst executive in the history of North American team sports, and no matter how legendary your pedigree, there comes a point in time when you just don't have it any more. Phil clearly hasn't had it since about 2008. Good riddance.</p>
