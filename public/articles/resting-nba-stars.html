<h1>Resting NBA Stars</h1>

<p>One epidemic is currently taking the NBA by storm and it is something practiced by many of the league’s top teams. As evidenced again last Saturday night, teams and coaches have decided to take nights off during primetime in the NBA. A strategy deployed nearly five seasons ago by Greg Poppovich, resting stars on back to back nights, no matter if it is a nationally televised game, has become a tactic used by many of the NBA’s top teams. While fans and the league may be disappointed and upset at these decisions and rightfully so, this strategy is something that makes plenty of sense from a coach’s perspective.</p>
<br>
<p>Greg Poppovich is a pioneer in today’s NBA and has proven that he does not need to play his stars to win on any given night. For example, the Spurs are 7-1 this season when LaMarcus Aldridge sits and 5-1 when Kawhi Leonard does not play. Now I am not saying these players do not have a major impact when they lace up to play, however, the ability to keep these players fresh and rested for the playoffs is something that creates a huge advantage when playing deep into June.</p>
<br>
<p>Much like the Spurs, the Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers have made headlines recently for sitting players during primetime games. These games have struggled to draw a crowd and have caused an uproar in the basketball community, however, I believe these players deserve the right to take a break at the fans expense.</p>
<br>
<p>To the Spurs, Warriors, and or Cavaliers these final 15 games are relatively meaningless. While teams would love to carry momentum into the playoffs, the Golden State Warriors learned last season first hand that fatigue can have a profound impact on a playoff series. Whether you believe that the Cavs 3-1 comeback was fatigue related or not, look at the number of games played by Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Steph Curry compared to the likes of Kevin Love, Lebron or Kyrie Irving. When teams of this caliber rightfully assume that they will play an excess of 28 games in the playoffs, they deserve the right to sit out 28 games if need be in the regular season. For those who make the argument that they get paid to play basketball, remember that their contracts only take into effect the 82 regular season games during the season. For us working folk in the “real world” would you like to put in 28 extra days throughout the course of the year knowing it will impact you when you need to perform at the highest level?</p>
<br>
<p>While this argument may not resignate with some, it is something to think about deciding how you feel about the resting stars epidemic.</p>
