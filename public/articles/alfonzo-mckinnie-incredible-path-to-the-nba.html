<h1>Alfonzo McKinnie's Incredible Path to the NBA</h1>

<p>Toronto Raptors forward Alfonzo McKinnie has had an incredible journey to professional basketball. McKinnie wasn’t a top high school player which limited what colleges gave him scholarships. With that, McKinnie had slim pickings of where he was going to play college basketball and decided to attend Eastern Illinois. However, that didn’t seem like a fit and McKinnie transferred to the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. At UW-Green Bay, McKinnie tore his meniscus twice and ended up getting it removed which hindered his play early on.</p>
<p>At UW-Green Bay, McKinnie worked his way from being a player who didn’t get minutes to a player who was one of UW-Green Bay’s top bench players. In McKinnie’s final college season he averaged 8 points and 5.3 rebounds on 45% from the field in only 21.6 minutes per game. Obviously not breathtaking numbers but that didn’t stop McKinnie from chasing his dream of playing in the NBA. McKinnie went undrafted in the 2015 NBA Draft, and many thought his days of playing basketball were over, or at least his NBA dream.</p>
<p>After going undrafted and not getting a training camp look from the NBA, McKinnie had to look elsewhere. With that, a team in a small league in Luxembourg ended up taking a chance on McKinnie, and he decided to go overseas and signed with the East Side Pirates. While overseas, McKinnie outclassed everyone and was the best player on the court, and finished the year averaging 26 points a game.</p>
<p>Following his successful season in Luxembourg, immediately after the season, McKinnie signed with Rayos de Hermosillo in a Mexican league. Once again, McKinnie was one of the better players starting 22 of the 25 games he played in and averaged 15.4 points and 7.3 rebounds. After the successful stints abroad, McKinnie realized it was now or never to make the NBA. For him to make the NBA, he realized the D-League was the best route. McKinnie then paid 175 dollars to attend the Windy City Bulls training camp and impressed enough to make the roster. In the D-League last season with the Bulls, McKinnie was one of the top players where he averaged 14.9 points and 9.2 rebounds per game in 30.5 minutes and was named a D-League All-Star. Evaluating his play last season McKinnie said, “Overall, I think I had a pretty solid season. Averaging almost a double-double, having a solid showcase performance and being selected to the all-star team. I went from a player no one really knew to a player that gained a lot of people’s attention.”</p>

<br>
<p>And gaining people’s attention is exactly what McKinnie did. McKinnie turned his All-Star season into a contract with the Toronto Raptors, and ended up making the team after an impressive training camp and pre-season, and is now the 13th man. However, for McKinnie he rarely sees minutes in the NBA playing only 7 games, but only really receives ‘garbage time’ minutes, and spends most of the time with the Raptors 905 of the G-League. With the 905 and given his experience in the G-League, he is expected to be the leader of the team.</p>
<p>Along with being a leader, McKinnie gets important minutes with the 905, something he isn’t receiving with the Raptors. While with the 905 he also has the chance to work on his game. And improving his game is something that he knows he needs to do. “I mean I kinda know the things that I need to work on to try and get minutes with the Raptors. But I just come down here and work on those things, and at the same time work on other stuff as well, cause I do play a lot of minutes when I am down, and I am one of the guys the team looks to to lead, so I gotta try and work on my all-around game.”</p>
<p>While being with the 905 helps his development even more, so does spending time with the Raptors. He gets to play against NBA players and learn how to be an NBA player from some of the best in the league like DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry.</p>
<p>“I mean it helps my development a lot just because the guys I am surrounded with at practice like Norm, DeMar, and guys like Fred and Pascal like those guys who came down here and played in the D-League,” added McKinnie. “And just to see how they produced, but man it has helped me out a lot already.”</p>
<p>Now using the expertise of the guys with the Raptors, McKinnie has come down to the 905 and became one of head coach, Jerry Stackhouse’s, go-to guys. So far with the 905, McKinnie in six games is averaging 33.0 minutes, 16.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 1.3 assists while shooting 46.8% from the field and 41.7% from three.</p>
<p>When McKinnie comes down to the 905 he can work on a single aspect of his game rather than trying to do everything on the court to get an NBA look, something he had to do last year. “I mean the only difference is it is a different organization as last year I was with Chicago’s D-League team, and Toronto this year,” McKinnie stated. “But there is no real difference, I mean even though I do play with the Raptors sometimes, when I come down it is the same objective as I was playing last year and just come out and do what I can do and help the team win. But now I got more eyes from one team on me now.”</p>
<p>After not being a top high school recruit, to going to a small school at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, to having to play in small leagues in Luxembourg and Mexico, then having to pay to try out for a D-League team, McKinnie has made the most of his opportunity and is now an NBA player. Something nobody thought was possible just a short time ago.</p>
