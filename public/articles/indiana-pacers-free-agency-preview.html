<h1>Indiana Pacers Free Agency Preview</h1>

<p>The Indiana Pacers finished last season as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference, and they got swept in the first round of the playoffs by the Cleveland Cavaliers. After going 42-40 last season, the Pacers face a number of questions this offseason. Their star, Paul George, has told the team that he won’t be back after next season. So, the Pacers management has to trade George and get some kind of value in return. Their starting point guard Jeff Teague will be hitting the free agent market too, so they will have to make a choice about which direction they want to lead the team down. Sophomore, Myles Turner, had a terrific season last year. He averaged 14.5 points and 7.3 rebounds per game last season. He was also a force on the defensive end averaging 2.1 blocks per game in 31.4 minutes per game. The Pacers drafted T.J. Leaf in the 2017 NBA Draft and will now turn their attention to the free agency period.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $32 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: None<br>
Unrestricted: Lavoy Allen, Aaron Brooks, C.J. Miles, and Jeff Teague</p>
<p>The Indiana Pacers must choose a direction before free agency starts. They don’t want to turn into a team stuck in the middle of trying to win and trying to rebuild at the same time. They have good veteran players hitting the market, but if they are going to enter a rebuild, there’s no point in bringing them back. However, if the team is still trying to compete next season, each player hitting the free agent market for the Pacers can make a case to be back. Lavoy Allen has been a solid bench player throughout his entire career, but he didn’t get a lot of playing time last season. If his playing time was increased again, he might be able to produce more for the team. Aaron Brooks is also a solid bench player. If the Pacers don’t re-sign him, he won’t have any problem finding a job elsewhere. C.J. Miles and Jeff Teague are the team’s most important free agents. Miles shot 41.3% from three-point range last season which helped the Pacers space the floor on offense. Jeff Teague was the team’s starting point guard, and he turned in 15.3 points and 7.8 assists per game while playing 32.4 minutes a night. If the Pacers decide to rebuild, they can let these players walk. If they want to win, they should try to re-sign each of the players on this list.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Tony Snell, Dion Waiters</p>
<p>If the Indiana Pacers decide to trade Paul George (the expected route), they will likely enter into a quick rebuild. However, signing guys like Tony Snell and Dion Waiters could speed up the rebuild very quickly. Tony Snell had a breakout season as a three and D guy for Milwaukee last season, and he would benefit immensely as a starter for the Pacers. Dion Waiters also had a breakout season in Miami last year. Giving Waiters the chance to be the main scoring threat could be a risk worth taking if you’re Indiana. Waiters has the potential to explode on any given night, and he would fit in well with Myles Turner.</p>
