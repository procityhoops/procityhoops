<h1>Kevin Durant's decision to join Golden State</h1>

<p>Roughly two weeks ago, the Golden State Warriors won their second NBA title in three years. Roughly a year ago, the Golden State Warriors blew a 3 – 1 series lead against LeBron James and his Cavaliers team. It was a moment of vindication for Cavs fans across the world – the Warriors team that broke the single season wins (73) record of perhaps one of the most storied and revered basketball teams in history (1996 Bulls, 72 wins) – had fallen to King James and a healthy Kyrie Irving. The unstoppable force met the immovable object, and for perhaps the first time in recorded history, the immovable object won.</p>
<p>Not long after the Warriors failed to cap their storybook 2015/16 season with a championship, they made one of the biggest moves in basketball since LeBron decided to take his talents to South Beach. The Warriors signed Kevin Durant, effectively assembling the best NBA team of all-time. Durant added strength and defensive depth to the perimeter offense heavy Warriors squad, and ultimately lead the Warriors to a championship, earning the playoff MVP award in the process. However, this article is not about the success of Kevin Durant – that can be read about anywhere.  Sure, he managed a career-high FG% (53.7) and BLK (1.6 per game), but whether or not Kevin Durant played well is not up for debate. He did play well. He's got a ring and an MVP trophy to prove it.</p>
<p>The less-glamorous yet intangible statistic that KD set a career-high in this year was unnecessary controversy. As soon as Durant announced his signing with the Warriors, the basketball world exploded with criticism, much even more furious than when LeBron joined Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami almost 8 years ago. Words like “ring hunter” were thrown around by everyone from no-name bloggers to Stephen A. Smith himself. Durant was accused of what essentially amounted to cowardice for leaving OKC in search of a championship. Durant was called soft, unfaithful, and a million other (much nastier) things. Now that Durant's first season in Oakland is behind him, and he proved to be the difference-maker, we must ask ourselves “Did KD actually do anything wrong?” The answer to that question is a resounding no.</p>
<p>Imagine this scenario. You're the manager at a retail chain. You're making good money, but it's hard, unforgiving work, and there's absolutely no room to move up – to make more money, to have a job that gives more satisfaction. That's exactly what OKC was like for KD. The arguments against him often start with “he left to join a superteam!” but many basketball fans forget that at one point Durant played on the same floor as Russell Westbrook and James Harden. Obviously, that trio is not Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, but with competent coaching and a little more unselfish play (Looking at you, Russell.) that is a team that should have won a championship. Durant is a world class player, and he gave nine years of his career to a team that refused to put the pieces around him to win. Durant leaving that situation draws parallels to LeBron's own exodus from Cleveland. A team he was drafted by, and fought and died for, that refused to get better around him. LeBron left Cleveland to go win titles with relative ease with his free agent based superteam. Durant joined a team that was built almost entirely on Steve Kerr's incredible coaching and a smart drafting and development system. If anyone is an honorless ring hunter, it's LeBron.</p>
<p>Let's suppose for a minute that KD's reasons for joining the Warriors were entirely based on a desire to win a championship. They very well may be, but let's suppose that there was no history of issues in the OKC dressing room and that KD hadn't built relationships with several Warriors players (namely Draymond Green). Is there actually anything wrong with wanting to win a championship? Don't players play to win the game? Is that not the entire point of sports? Even if KD's decision to join the Warriors was entirely based on a desire to win, there is nothing wrong that. Top level talent is driven to the top level by a desire to win. Again, LeBron James did the same thing when he joined the Miami Heat. After years of heartbreaking playoff losses, LeBron got tired of losing and went somewhere where he could win. When you're world class talent in a league that is rapidly becoming a four-team league, you go where you win, or you spend years toiling in misery.  Kevin Durant made an upwards career move that resulted in one of his best seasons ever and capped it off with a ring and a Finals MVP award. Not only is the criticism of him unnecessary, but Durant doesn’t care either.</p>
