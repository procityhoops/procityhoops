<h1>Are the Lakers back?</h1>

<p>It has been an eventful summer in Hollywood, as the Lakers have made moves this summer, starting with the addition of Magic Johnson and new GM Rob Pelinka. The name Pelinka might sound familiar to the more than average basketball fan. He is a widely known agent and former agent of one of the greatest Lakers of all-time, Kobe Bryant. What can a former agent bring to the table? It is hard to say a few months into his tenure, but Pelinka and Johnson have formed a nice duo in the front office.  Laker fans can thank former GM Mitch Kupchak for what he did during his tenure. You can’t knock a guy who brought championships to the city. You simply can’t. Winning in a city like Los Angeles isn’t easy. Winning is expected, and if you have a string of losing seasons, which the Lakers have had, things must change. Johnson and Pelinka were brought in to make an immediate impact and add pieces to their young core.</p>
<p>Enter Brandon Ingram. The near seven-footer is the centerpiece in the Laker organization, and with the addition of Lonzo Ball in the backcourt, ShowTime might just be back. The last two number two overall picks in the last two drafts are expected to be the future of L.A. and hope to lead the city back to glory.</p>
<p>After trading away D’Angelo Russell to the Nets for Brook Lopez and a draft pick, the Lakers have a solid lineup heading into the 2017-2018 season. With the addition of Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (KCP) and a flurry of young players, the Lakers look like they are heading in the right direction. It was hard to watch them the past few seasons. You have to give Kobe his due, but the losing was tough. Now that the Kobe era has come and gone, team basketball must be the priority instead of relying on a superstar. The Golden State Warriors have plenty of superstars on their roster and a lot of egos, but they must play together as a team. Look at Lebron’s first year in Miami. They looked lost in the NBA Finals against Dallas. They came back a year later, played as a team, and won back-to-back championships.</p>

<p>With the way the Warriors have changed the dynamic of basketball, teams are shifting the way they rebuild. The big man is non-existent in the NBA. If you count how many relevant big men there are in the NBA, you know that isn’t many. I would say DeAndre Jordan, DeMarcus Cousins, Rudy Gobert, Hassan Whiteside and just a few others are premiere centers. Most teams are going small. You have a player like Draymond Green who is a beast on the boards and gives up four or five inches to most guys in the paint.</p>
<p>Now the Lakers have added Brook Lopez, Thomas Bryant, and Steven Zimmerman down low for the upcoming season. Those are all big men, but two of those big men can stretch the floor and knock down jumpers consistently. With Kyle Kuzma having a stellar summer, the future is bright. Josh Hart, national champion from Villanova, adds depth to the guard position that the Lakers desperately needed. Vander Blue, a G-League All-Star, also makes the squad and hopes to provide a spark off the bench.</p>
<p>We know the Lakers are a few years away, but this is the most talented team they have had in almost four or five years, so the excitement is expected, but so are the results. Luke Walton adds his former college teammate at Arizona, Miles Simon, to his staff. Simon is popular amongst young players and hopes to bring his knowledge of the game.</p>
<p>It will be tough seeing these young Lakers face Golden State four times a year, but a team must compete against the best to beat them. Laker fans should be excited for what is yet to come. Ingram and Ball can be a force in the league for years to come if they stay healthy, know their roles, and provide leadership the Lakers have been missing since Kobe retired. It is a solid building block for the future and we might just see a Lakers/Celtics Finals in the next 10 years. Just maybe.</p>
