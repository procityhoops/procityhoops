<h1>Rookies That Need New Teams</h1>
<p>The NBA season is already half over and there are quite a few rookies who have been disappointing. In fact, some people are calling this one of the worst draft classes in recent memory. Although it’s true that the #1 pick, Ben Simmons, hasn’t even played yet, we can think of a few players that could already use a change of scenery. Here are the three rookies that would already benefit from playing on a different team.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Kris Dunn, Timberwolves</b></h4>
<p>Kris Dunn has probably been one of the more disappointing storylines this season. The (nearly) 23 year old point guard from Providence selected with the number five pick inspired people with his story to the league. Dunn is currently on the struggling Minnesota Timberwolves averaging 3.6 PPG, 2.5 APG, and 1.4 TOV while playing over 16 minutes every game. Dunn is currently in the backup point guard role, but fan-favorite Tyus Jones is sneaking up behind him. Dunn isn’t a great fit in the Wolves current system and would have a chance of playing better on a different team. The first team Dunn could make more of an impact on is the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Cavaliers are in need of a backup point guard and defense from their second unit, and Dunn fits both of those roles. Dunn could facilitate to sharpshooters on the Cavs such as Channing Frye and J.R Smith (when he returns from injury) while helping out Cleveland’s need for defense. The next team Kris Dunn could thrive with are the Phoenix Suns. The Suns current backup point guard is Brandon Knight. The word “struggling” would be an understatement in describing Knight this season and Dunn could replace him on their bench. Dunn could be more of a focal point on Phoenix and be groomed under a point guard with a similar playing style in Eric Bledsoe.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Jaylen Brown, Celtics</b></h4>
<p>Jaylen Brown isn’t playing poorly, but he’s not exactly lighting it up either. Brown is currently playing for the surprisingly thrilling Boston Celtics and averaging 5.7 PPG, .06 APG, and 2.6 RPG while playing 15.5 MPG. Jaylen Brown is the backup small forward on the Celtics right now, but there is little to no chance of Jaylen Brown leapfrogging Jae Crowder in the near-future. The first team that could benefit from the addition of Jaylen Brown is the Los Angeles Clippers. Los Angeles is in need of small forwards badly. Brown could be the main man off of the Clippers bench with a chance to start either this year or next. Jaylen Brown could also learn from defensive specialist Luc Mbah a Moute and former Celtic, Paul Pierce. I can envision this would be a great addition to an already good Clippers team. The next team that Jaylen Brown could strive for is the Philadelphia 76ers. The 76ers are one of the youngest teams in the NBA and are showing real potential this season. Brown could backup Robert Covington right now and take over the starting role next season. Brown could also give this young team what it needs right now, defense. Electric rookie Joel Embiid could lead this team on the offensive end, and Brown could be the floor general on defense. This would be an exciting duo to watch and would benefit Philadelphia tremendously.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Buddy Hield, New Orleans Pelicans</b></h4>
<p>Buddy Hield started off very slow, but hit a hot streak in December. While he has cooled off since then, the 23 year old shooting guard from the Bahamas is still averaging decent totals. Hield is currently on the New Orleans Pelicans and is averaging 8.6 PPG, 2.9 RPG, and 1.4 APG while playing 20.4 MPG. Hield is also hitting on just below 37% of his shots from beyond the arc so far this season. What he does have going for him in New Orleans is the chance to start every night. Hield has actually started over half (36 GS in 56 GP) of the games this year for New Orleans. While he does have this opportunity, his talents may be being wasted by the Pelicans as he is surrounded by a lackluster team, apart from Anthony Davis. The first team that Hield would be better on are the Milwaukee Bucks. The Bucks are currently out of the playoffs, but small forward Giannis Antetokounmpo gives them a chance to win every night. Hield could be one of the main scoring options off the Milwaukee Bucks bench. Hield could potentially make his way into the sixth man role on the Bucks and would boost their win total while at the same time furthering his potential. The second team that Hield could help are the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Thunder are in need of a sharpshooter to pair with Russell Westbrook and Buddy Hield could be the perfect match. Hield would be the main guard off the bench and has the ability to take over Victor Oladipo’s starting role. Hield would provide scoring for the Thunder and a backcourt of Hield and Westbrook could threaten teams for years to come.</p>
<br>
<p>While the reality is many rookies take a year to adjust to the high level of play in the NBA, it’s nice to see more progress than these three are showing. They will get better over time, but these new teams would expedite this process.</p>
