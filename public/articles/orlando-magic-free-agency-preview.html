<h1>Orlando Magic Free Agency Preview</h1>

<p>The Orlando Magic finished the 2016-2017 NBA season with a record of 29-53, putting them 13th in the Eastern Conference. The Magic haven’t made the playoffs since the 2011-2012 season when Dwight Howard was still around. Worse yet, the Magic don’t have much to build on from last season. They have some talented players in Elfrid Payton, Aaron Gordon, and Nikola Vucevic, but that core hasn’t had much success. Magic fans have wanted to see winning basketball and have been waiting for five years. The Magic tried to buck the trend of the NBA last season, and they tried a roster heavy on big men. Obviously, the plan didn’t work, and they now have to hit the reset button. The Magic got off on the right foot in the 2017 NBA Draft. They drafted Jonathan Isaac out of Florida State who will be a defensive stopper immediately and has the chance to develop into a solid offensive player too. Now, with Isaac and some other pieces in place, what players in free agency could get Orlando over the hump.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $18 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: None<br>
Unrestricted: Jeff Green, Jodie Meeks, and Damjan Rudez</p>
<p>The Orlando Magic don’t have a big problem with their pending free agents. They could look to hang on to Jeff Green who averaged 9.2 points per game while playing just 22.1 minutes per night last season. Green is still a solid veteran that has playoff experience, and he can help show the Magic’s young talent what it takes to win. Jodie Meeks and Damjan Rudez, on the other hand, aren’t worth keeping around. Jodie Meeks is a solid player when he’s healthy, but in the last three seasons, he hasn’t played over 60 games in a season. He played just 36 games for the Magic in his first season with the team. Damjan Rudez was a roster filler for last season, and he will likely not return to the team.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Dion Waiters, James Johnson</p>
<p>The Orlando Magic are lacking in shooting guards and wing players. Dion Waiters could slide into the two-guard position and boost the Orlando offense immediately. Waiters averaged 15.8 points per game for the Magic while shooting 39.5% from three-point range. Waiters will give the Magic a nice shooting threat who will benefit from Elfrid Payton’s passing ability. James Johnson would also be able to help Orlando’s offense and give the team a defensive toughness. Johnson is coming off his best season as a pro averaging 12.8 points and 4.9 rebounds per game. Adding a player of Waiters’ or Johnson’s caliber would give the Magic a nice boost from going from ‘mediocre’ to ‘superb.’</p>
