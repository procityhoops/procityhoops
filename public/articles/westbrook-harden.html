<p>For much of the season, there has been an intriguing debate going around the league: Russell Westbrook or James Harden? Russell Westbrook is currently averaging a triple double and has now put up 40 points in four straight games, but the Thunder sit in the seventh seed in the West. On the other hand, James Harden has the Rockets in the third spot in the West, while averaging 28.8 PPG, 11.3 APG, and 8.0 RPG. So that brings up the question, who's better?</p>

<br>

<h4><b>The case for Russell Westbrook:</b></h4>
<p>Russell Westbrook is currently averaging 31.7 PPG, 10.7 RPG, and 10.1 APG. Russell Westbrook has 30 triple doubles this year and is on his way to making history. He has single handily brought the Thunder into the seventh seed in the West, just 8 months after losing Kevin Durant to the Warriors. Along with averaging a triple double, and bringing the Thunder into the seven seed in the West, he has done it with a sub-par supporting cast. The next highest scorer on the Thunder is Victor Oladipo averaging 16.1 points per game, which is over 15 points less than Westbrook per game. Although Russell Westbrook's usage rate is 42.1%, highest in the league, in order for the Thunder to win games, he has to try to take over. When watching Westbrook this season, it seems as if when he wants a bucket, he will get it. Although Westbrook is only shooting 34.1% from downtown, it is the best mark in his career and more often than not, he is attacking the basket. In the shot chart below, you can see the percentages Westrbook is shooting and what shots he is taking the most. He doesn't have the best shot chart, but the positive is that most of his shots are coming from mid-range and in the paint. We are observing something special in Russell Westbrook and for the Thunder fan base, they should be happy that they get to watch the best point guard night in and night out.</p>

<h4><b>The case for James Harden:</b></h4>
<p>Obviously the case for James Harden is the way the Rockets have been playing this season, along with the numbers he has been putting up. Although, Harden is still listed as a shooting guard, he has been playing with the ball in his hands for the majority of the season and it is paying off for the Rockets and for Harden. The Rockets put up the most threes in the NBA and Harden is also putting up his fair share. Harden has attempted 562 threes this season, but has made just 35.1% of them. Harden is obviously putting up the numbers, but his team is also the third in the West. Clearly Harden has a great supporting cast with guys like Ryan Anderson, Eric Gordon, and previously acquired Lou Williams and this is a big factor in the Rockets winning percentage. Now, looking at Harden's shot chart shown below, you can see he has a lot of "green" areas. Harden has multiple hot zones and is shooting over 65% in the paint, a better number than Westbrook. Harden has a 33.9% usage rate, which is over 8% less than Westbrook, so you could say that Harden is putting up better numbers with the amount he is being used. With all of that being said, lets take a look at who is the better player and who should win the 2017 Most Valuable Player award.</p>

<h4><b>Conclusion:</b></h4>
<p>Obviously both players are unique in their own ways, but with the teams that each player has and what has been going on this season, I think Russell Westbrook is not only the better of the two players, but also deserves to win the MVP award. The things that Russell Westbrook is doing with a sub par supporting cast is eye opening. Harden is putting up numbers in his own right, but what Westbrook is doing this season can't be denied.</p>
