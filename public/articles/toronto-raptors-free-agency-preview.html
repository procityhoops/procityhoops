<h1>Toronto Raptors Free Agency Preview</h1>

<p>The Raptors finished last season tied for the second best record in the Eastern Conference at 51-31. After receiving the third seed in the East, Toronto was swept in the second round of the playoffs by Cleveland and their season came to a disappointing end. Led by guard tandem DeMar DeRozan (27.3 PPG and 5.2 RPG) and Kyle Lowry (22.4 PPG and 7 APG), the Raptors isolation-based offense isn’t getting it done. This offseason is a big one for the Raptors and will determine their future going forward as a team.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $20 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted:  None<br>
Unrestricted: Kyle Lowry, Serge Ibaka, Patrick Patterson, and PJ Tucker</p>
<p>Two out of the Raptors four free agents are starters on the team, and many experts predict the Raptors will lose at least one of them. Serge Ibaka is due for a big payday and after playing the last half of the season last year, Toronto should let him walk. Although he averaged 14.2 PPG and 6.8 RPG for the Raptors last season, he didn’t have the effect Toronto wanted and isn’t crucial to their team. Kyle Lowry is a more complicated matter. The 31 year-old point guard has played with Toronto his entire career and the Raptors don’t want to let him go. The identity of the team has been Lowry and DeRozan for more than five years now, and it would be hard to see them without him. The Raptors will need to offer Lowry a max if they want a chance to retain him. PJ Tucker is likely to leave but Patrick Patterson should be a cheaper value play for the Raptors and they should re-sign him this offseason.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Joe Ingles, Alan Williams</p>
<p>Joe Ingles shot over 44% from three last season and will be in for a huge payday. After being one of the worst three point shooting teams in the league last season, an elite three-point shooter should be on the top of the Raptors list this summer. Although Alan Williams is a restricted free agent, the Raptors should give their best effort to sign Williams to a deal. The 24 year-old big man averaged almost 7 rebounds per game last season and young rebounders are always nice to come by.</p>
