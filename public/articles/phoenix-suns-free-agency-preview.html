<h1>Phoenix Suns Free Agency Preview</h1>

<p>The Phoenix Suns finished the 2016-2017 NBA season with a 24-58 record, ranking last in the Western Conference. Although they finished last in the West, the Suns had some bright spots on the season. Up and coming guard, Devin Booker, finished the season averaging 22.1 points per game, up from his 13.8 points per game in his rookie season. Rookie forward Marquese Chriss came on towards the end of the season and averaged 12.5 points per game in the months of March and April. Also in those months, Chriss averaged 6.4 rebounds a night. Another strong spot in the otherwise lousy season was Tyler Ulis. The rookie guard out of Kentucky ended the season averaging 7.3 points and 3.7 assists per game. He saw the court more towards the end of the season once starting point guard Eric Bledsoe went down with an injury. The Suns drafted Josh Jackson with the fourth pick in the NBA Draft on Thursday night and added to their already young nucleus. The Suns now have a core of Bledsoe, Booker, Jackson, Chriss, Ulis, and Dragan Bender. But, what can they do to further improve their roster this summer?</p>

<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $29 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: Alex Len, Alan Williams<br>
Unrestricted: Ronnie Price</p>
<p>The Phoenix Suns shouldn’t be too worried about their impending free agents. The biggest name on the list is Alan Williams. Williams averaged 7.4 points and 6.2 rebounds per game last season. He is also just 24 years old. Williams will likely find some money in free agency, but no offer will be big enough where the Suns won’t be able to match. The Suns can also match any offer on Alex Len. Len hasn’t produced the way Phoenix has wanted him to when they drafted him, but he still has value on the team. He is still young (24 years old), and he’s a terrific backup big man in the NBA.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>Danilo Gallinari, Serge Ibaka</p>
<p>The Phoenix Suns ownership wants to start winning. Signing players like Danilo Gallinari and Serge Ibaka would give them a boost in that direction. The Suns are a very young team, and one of their only veteran leaders is Eric Bledsoe. Gallinari would be a great mentor to Josh Jackson, and he could show him the ropes of the NBA. Gallinari would also be able to contribute to Phoenix right away in terms of production. Serge Ibaka could also bring the Suns a veteran leader. He would be able to mentor guys like Dragan Bender and Alan Williams into solid NBA players. Ibaka would also bring a much-needed energy to a Phoenix team that won just 24 games last season.</p>
