<h1>Moving the Max</h1>

<p>Is it never too early (or too late) to talk about the NBA offseason. One of the favorite games for NBA pundits to play is called “Guess the Trend.” There are three rules: Spot the trend before anyone else does, write about it, and be right.</p>

<p>Here’s my stab at it. During late January of this year, Blake Griffin was traded to the Detroit Pistons. Most basketball writers may not have been in love with the trade but, they understood it. SVG’s job in Detroit is in serious jeopardy, and the former Dwight-whisperer needed to make a splash. Yet, examining the Clippers’ motive is more revealing. Jerry West and company over in Los Angeles desperately wanted to move off of Blake Griffin’s awful contract. They had too much money tied up in an injury-riddled player; a player who’s style of basketball is being outpaced by today’s Pace and Space game.</p> 

<p>So, is this “Movin’ the Max” trend going to catch fire in the NBA? This offseason, some front offices will be looking to move on from their recently signed long-term deals, even if the ink is still dry. The problem? Not too many teams have cap space to take on these players. So, who are these prospective hoopers who could be switching teams this offseason?</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Introducing - Andrew Wiggins</b></h4>
<p>Coach Thibs has done a respectable job with his Timberwolves. Sure, the roster looks like his Bulls reincarnated but, they are in the middle of a vicious Western Conference playoff hunt. Yet, Andrew Wiggins is amidst his worst season since his rookie year. Both the eye test and the stats back it up.</p>

<p>The fella once dubbed as Maple Jordan is hitting only 44% of his field goals for 17.9 points per game, both numbers have not been this low since his freshman campaign in the Association. Ready for this next barrage of stats? His win shares, true shooting percentage, assist rate, PER, free throw rate, offensive rebound rate, and corner three percentage are all his worst ever! Still, Wiggins showed promise last year. What changed? Jimmy Butler came in.</p>

<p>Butler has been a revelation for this squad, sure. It is not hard to see, however, how his arrival has relegated Wiggins to a role unsuitable for his game. He is not effective as a third option, floor spacer; a guy who has little touches and therefore takes ugly mid-range jumpers whenever he gets the rock. But, look at Wiggins’ numbers since Butler went down with injury. He is putting up 21 PPG, hitting 41% of his threes on five attempts per game and 46% of his field goals. Plus, his assist numbers have jumped up considerably, something people have been waiting to see from A. Wiggins. The Wolves have taken advantage of his post-up game and it seems as though being a second option is best for this young talent. Also, his added offensive responsibility has led to improved defense. In an adage, I will repeat until the death of me “everyone plays defense when they touch the ball.”</p>

<p>For both parties, it could make sense to move off from Andrew Wiggins’ 25-million-dollar salary. His poison pill contract extends this summer, and Minnesota has Butler’s extension looming. The Timberwolves could look to add some expiring contracts and shooters. They should look to Phoenix. The Suns could offer both Jared Dudley and Tyson Chandler, two expiring contracts, and breakout trey specialist Troy Daniels. Phoenix would also have to throw in their two mid-first rounders, which are currently sitting at 15 and 16 respectively. The Wolves get future cap flexibility and cheap assets while Phoenix puts an exciting core of Booker, Jackson, Wiggins, and a 2018 lottery pick on their court next year.</p>

<h4><b>Next Up – Andre Drummond</b></h4>
<p>*Acknowledges UConn bias. Drummond is having his best year as a pro. Scratch that. He was having his best year. Then, Blake Griffin came. In the month prior to Blake’s arrival, Drummond was operating like a pro out of the high post. The dude was solely responsible for any Detroit offense and it showed. The center averaged 4.4 assists in the month of January. Since BG came along Drummond has averaged a mere 1.7 assists in February and 1.2 dimes in March so far. Wow. The drop off is drastic. Yet, Blake has put up a career-high number of dishes. Simply put, having two elite passing big men on a team may be redundant.</p> 

<p>Andre’s salary is much easier to move than Blake’s, as he makes about six million less than the former Clipper. Personally, I would prefer to see Griffin’s contract moved because of how much cap space it eats (and will continue to eat.) Good luck finding a partner, however. Yet, this does not mean Drummond is very movable. He is a good passer, but no Jokic. Oh, and his range is nonexistent. Still, a team looking to play a slower pace with a great rim-running, alley-oop catcher may show interest.</p>

<p>Who could be a potential trade option during this offseason? Well, Detroit would want shooters to surround Blake with. Also, these players have to be expiring contracts for the 2019 season or else, what’s the point of moving Drummond? (Copy and paste Phoenix trade here). We know that Milwaukee has been eyeing a center for some time, and Portland may favor obtaining Drummond rather than paying Nurkic. One of the somewhat rational ideas I came across was focused on sending Drummond to Washington but, John Wall’s impending extension muddies up the salary numbers.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Speaking of Wizards – John Wall</b></h4>
<p>Take a deep breath, Wizards fans. Count to ten. Let’s not overreact here.</p>

<p>Okay, let’s overreact. The Wizards are 12-7 since Wall’s injury; a record that is only decent upon first glance. When considering that this squad has played 14 of those games against playoff teams, that record starts to look pretty impressive. I’ll save you from reading through a plethora of “Are They Better Without Wall” articles and just share some quick stats. The Wiz are averaging more assists without Wall and put up a somewhat solid defensive rating. The eye test says it all, though. This current team moves the ball like NBA teams should move the ball. Bradley Beal is averaging over 6.5 assists since Wall went down. Sure, they could use that late game firepower from Wall. But, at what price?</p>

<p>The former #1 overall pick is set to make 37 million bucks next season. Gulp. Although healthy in recent years, Wall still has injury history and averages only 68 games played per year. Does he have a game that will age well? I’m not so sure. His game is built on speed and athleticism; something that certainly does not improve as you get older. Will he alter his game to stay effective? Considering Wall is a lifetime 32% three point shooter, I am not so sure. Want to feel sick? Just look at his upcoming salary!</p>

<br>
<p>Do you want to pay this type of guard $46 million when he’s 31? Me neither.</p>

<p>Is Wall even tradable now? Maybe. This injury did not help but, people around the League still recognize his talent. On the right team, he could be making deep playoff runs again. Plus, the Wizards could achieve some much-needed cap space in order to eventually re-sign Oubre, as well as other free agents. So, what’s the deal? I have thrown this one out there before and will do so again. Denver gets Wall and sends back Plumlee, expiring contract Faried and Jamal Murray. Giving up Murray is tough, but Denver might realize that to make a real run in the West, they need more star power. Teaming up Wall with Jokic could form a deadly Pick-N-Pop combination. The quartet of Wall, Jokic, Harris, and Millsap could make some noise. Washington gets an off-ball shooter to pair with newly ordained playmaker Bradley Beal, as well as a nice expiring contract. Do both these teams have the guts to do it, however? Wizards fans better hope so, because getting off of John Wall’s contract will be nearly impossible after this year.</p>
