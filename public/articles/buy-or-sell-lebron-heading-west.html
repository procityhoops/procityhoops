<h1>Buy or Sell: LeBron James heading West?</h1>

<p>According to Kevin O’Connor of The Ringer, league sources are telling him that some NBA executives believe that LeBron James will head West in the 2018 free agency. LeBron is an unrestricted free agent in 2018, and O’Connor states that there is a possibility that LeBron could join either the Lakers or the Clippers. It’s built around the idea that Paul George would also head to the Lakers in 2018, and LeBron and Paul George could team up in LA to make a championship run. Going to the Clippers is based on LeBron playing with his group of friends. Last season LeBron said: “I really hope that, before our career is over, we can all play together. ... At least one, maybe one or two seasons -- me, Melo, D-Wade, CP -- we can get a year in.” LeBron made a promise to Cleveland that he would get them a title, but he didn’t say he would stay forever.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Consensus</b></h4>
<p>Sell the rumor hard. In the summer of 2010, LeBron made the move to go to Miami. In 2014, he came back to Cleveland. It’s unlikely that LeBron will bolt Cleveland again and move his family. If he moves West, it would be challenging for LeBron to even make another Finals with Golden State also in the Western Conference. If LeBron and his buddies want to play together, it will likely have to be in Cleveland because LeBron doesn’t seem to be headed anywhere. For now, keep the rumor in mind, but it’s extremely unlikely that anything actually happens.</p>
