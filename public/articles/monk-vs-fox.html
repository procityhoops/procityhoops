	<h1>Malik Monk vs. DeAaron Fox</h1>
	
	<p>John Calipari is likely the best college basketball recruiter in the nation and consistently sends multiple players to the first round of the NBA draft. This year will be no different as Calipari has three players likely to be first round draft picks. Malik Monk, De’Aaron Fox, and Bam Adebayo are all sure to be taken by the end of the first round. The two who will probably make the biggest difference early in their NBA careers are Malik Monk and De’Aaron Fox.</p><br>
	
	<p>Malik Monk is 6 feet 3 inches tall and plays mostly shooting guard for the Kentucky Wildcats. Monk has been having a spectacular freshman year at Kentucky where he has put up some impressive scoring outputs. The highlight of Monk’s season came on December 17 when he scored 47 points on 18/28 shooting in a win over North Carolina. That game showcased everything that Monk can do at an elite level. His three point shooting is arguably the best of any college player in the country and he shot 8/12 from long range in that game.</p><br>

	<p>Monk’s best quality is his killer instinct from three point territory. This season he is shooting over 40% and has shown an ability to hit shots off the dribble and coming off screens. Monk also has a quality pull up mid range jumper. Possibly his most underrated skill is his crazy athleticism that he mostly utilizes to showcase highlight reel dunks. One word to describe all of Malik Monk’s strengths would be lethal; his shooting touch has the ability to put opposing teams away quickly.</p><br>

	<p>If there was one thing NBA scouts want to see more of, it would likely be for Malik Monk to utilize his athleticism more. Despite being just 6 feet 3 inches, Monk has the athleticism to be a potential dunk contest participant in the years to come. However, he does not crash the offensive or defensive glass as NBA teams would want. Another thing that Monk will need to improve before he can be considered a future NBA star is his ability to get to the free throw line. This is another skill that Monk could turn into a strength with his athleticism. He also will need to show that he can have a higher assist rate than he currently does at Kentucky since he consistently plays with two point guards on the floor. Most of his weaknesses are effort skills that should be easily fixed.</p><br>

	<p>A player who does have the passing ability that Monk needs to showcase is his college teammate at Kentucky, De’Aaron Fox. Fox is also 6 feet 3 inches tall but has a slight advantage over Monk in that his game fits better at the point guard position so he typically matches up better defensively than Monk. Fox has not disappointed in his freshman season after entering with a lot of hype as the sixth ranked player in the 2016 recruiting class. He has had a number of quality games for Kentucky with the pinnacle being his triple double performance against Arizona State. Fox finished with 14 points, 10 assists, and 11 rebounds in a blowout victory on November 28.</p><br>

	<p>Fox shares many similar strengths as his teammate Monk with the athleticism required from NBA point guards today. He shows a natural feel for the game that is unteachable. He shows his instincts through his pinpoint passes and ability to control an offense even against top level defenders. Some of his best plays come on fast breaks after shutting down opposing point guards. He looks to push the ball up the floor and has a variety of options on the break. On various fast breaks Fox has shown the ability to pull up from mid range, finish at the rim, and throw lobs to athletic teammates.</p><br>

	<p>Nobody is a perfect player though and Fox has a few things that he will need to improve on before he will even be considered as a top point guard in a draft class that includes Lonzo Ball and Markelle Fultz. Possibly his biggest weakness is his streaky shooting. All shooters go through tough stretches but Fox has gone several games at a time without making a shot from long range. He has a quick release and a decent form but hasn’t shown the ability to consistently make long range jumpers like NBA point guards need to be able to do. He will also want to add some muscle as he often looks skinny and lanky on the court even against college players. With potentially a month and a half left in Kentucky’s season, Fox will hopefully be able to show that he can make long range shots consistently and play with his smaller frame.</p><br>

	<p>NBA scouts often show up in large numbers to Kentucky’s games as every game is an opportunity to see a potential franchise player. As for my decision, I would pick De’Aaron Fox over Malik Monk because of Fox’s natural instinct at the point guard position that is needed to win championships at the highest level. I believe Fox can do a good job adjusting to the NBA with similar size to Monk, but a better playing style for his height. I see Monk becoming more of an high quality shooter in the NBA than an all around star as Fox has the potential to be.</p><br>
