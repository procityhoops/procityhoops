<p>The Denver Nuggets turned in a successful 2016-2017 NBA season. They didn’t make the playoffs, but they finished 40-42 and one game out of the playoffs. The Nuggets were led by rising star Nikola Jokic. Jokic finished the season averaging 16.7 points and 9.8 rebounds per game. He also dished out 4.9 assists per game which is really impressive for a center. Nikola Jokic also had a lot of help. Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler, Gary Harris, and Will Barton all averaged over 13 points for the Nuggets last season. Had the Nuggets had more experience down the stretch, they might have found themselves sitting in the playoffs just a couple months ago. However, Nuggets fans have many things to be excited about. With an already established core, who can the Nuggets add to surround Jokic with to make the postseason next year?</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $41 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: Mason Plumlee<br>
Unrestricted: Danilo Gallinari, Roy Hibbert</p>
<p>The first thing the Nuggets will have to focus on in free agency is locking up their own free agents. Coming over in a trade from the Blazers mid-season, Mason Plumlee averaged 10.4 points and 7.5 rebounds per game last season and is a terrific fit next to Jokic. Since Plumlee is a solid fit next to Nikola Jokic, the Nuggets should keep him around. Plumlee is a physical player on the block and can defend with the best centers in the NBA. The next player the Nuggets have to worry about is Danilo Gallinari. Gallinari is a main piece on the Denver roster, and he is the second leading scorer on the team. Gallinari will command big money this offseason, but if the Nuggets want to make the playoffs next season, it would be smart to hang onto him. As for Roy Hibbert, the Nuggets can let him walk. Hibbert won’t provide anything to the Nuggets other than size, but the Nuggets already have Jokic and Plumlee.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>George Hill, Ersan Ilyasova</p>
<p>The Nuggets main problem last season was their point guard play. Emmanuel Mudiay hasn’t proven that he can lead an offense yet. Pursuing George Hill would allow the Nuggets to bring Mudiay off the bench. Hill had his best offensive season last year averaging 16.9 points and 4.1 assists per game. Hill would be another veteran leader on a Nuggets team that is hoping to slide into the playoffs. Then, adding Ersan Ilyasova would provide another bench threat. The Nuggets have Kenneth Faried as their backup power forward, but he doesn’t provide a ton of value in today’s NBA, especially off the bench. Ilyasova would put another veteran in the locker room who could stretch the floor off the bench. Ilyasova wouldn’t have to play a ton of minutes for Denver, but he would provide a solid three-point shooter for the Nuggets when Jokic gets a break.</p>
