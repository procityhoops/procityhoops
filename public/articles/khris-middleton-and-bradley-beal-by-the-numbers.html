<p>There are some terrific shooting guards in the NBA, but when the best shooting guards around the league is discussed, Bradley Beal’s name will come up, but Khris Middleton’s name will not. Is there a reason, or does Khris Middleton just fly under the radar? Let’s take a look in this edition of “By the Numbers.”</p>

<p>To start off, Bradley Beal (24) is two years younger than Khris Middleton (26), so there is always the argument that Beal will be outperforming Middleton when Beal is in his prime. This season, Bradley Beal is averaging 23.1 points per game while shooting 35.2% from three-point range. Khris Middleton is averaging 20.8 points per game while shooting 35.6% from distance. So, the points and offensive numbers go in favor of Beal, right? Not so fast. Although Beal is averaging 2.3 more points per game than Middleton, Beal has a usage rate of 29%, where Middleton has a usage rate of 25% this season. Beal is more of a focal point for the Wizards than Middleton is for the Bucks. Beal primarily only competes with John Wall for shots in Washington where Middleton has Antetokounmpo and Bledsoe on his team. So, while Beal is averaging more points than Middleton, Beal is getting more touches and being used more so the difference on the offensive end is minimal.</p> 

<p>Now to the defensive side of the ball. This season, Khris Middleton is averaging 1.7 steals and 0.2 blocks per game. Beal, on the other hand, is averaging 1.1 steals and 0.4 blocks per game. In addition, Middleton is a better rebounder than Beal. This season Middleton is grabbing 5.2 rebounds per game compared to Beal’s 4.3 rebounds per game. While the difference is minimal, rebounding is a big deal in today’s NBA.</p>

<p>Finally, let’s take a look at the on-off court splits for both players this season. When Khris Middleton is on the floor for the Milwaukee Bucks this season, the team’s offensive rating is 113.4. When Middleton is off the floor for the Bucks this season, the team’s offensive rating drops to 100.6, a 12.8 difference. With Beal on the floor this season, the Wizards’ offensive rating is 110.0. When Beal takes a breather, the Wizards’ offensive rating drops to just 105.3, just a 4.7 difference. While there are other players that go into those two numbers, Khris Middleton has a much greater impact on the Bucks’ offensive rating this season than Beal does on the Wizards’.</p>

<p>While both players have a huge impact on their respective teams, it is not fair to conclude who is the better overall player. Both players have their strengths, and they use them very well. But, now people can see that Khris Middleton has been flying under the radar since he is putting up similar numbers to someone who gets talked about way more often: Bradley Beal. So, NBA fans, it is time to start including Khris Middleton’s name when the top shooting guards in the NBA is discussed.</p>
