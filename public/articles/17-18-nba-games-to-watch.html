<p>With the full 2017-18 NBA schedule finally releasing, it’s time to take a look at what games NBA fans should be keeping their eye on.</p>
<h4><b>Boston Celtics @ Cleveland Cavaliers, October 17th</b></h4>
<p>With the Celtics and Cavaliers battling on opening night, it will be the first time that NBA fans will be able to see the new-look Celtics. The Celtics traded Avery Bradley away this offseason and signed all-star, Gordon Hayward. The team also used the third overall selection in the 2017 NBA Draft to take Duke forward, Jayson Tatum. Both players will make their Celtics’ debut in a Eastern Conference Finals rematch from 2017. This could also mark the first game that Kyrie Irving is not a member of the Cavaliers since the 2010-11 season.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Houston Rockets @ Golden State Warriors, October 17th</b></h4>
<p>The Golden State Warriors open the 2017-18 season at home against the new-look Rockets. It will be ring night for the defending NBA champions which makes it a compelling contest to watch. On top of ring night, it will also be the first chance for fans to see the Rockets with their new look. The Rockets made a blockbuster trade this offseason that brought the team Chris Paul to pair next to James Harden. The team will also be without several key contributors from the team last season including Patrick Beverley, Lou Williams, and Sam Dekker.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Los Angeles Lakers @ Sacramento Kings, November 22nd</b></h4>
<p>A matchup of two of the top point guards in the 2017 NBA Draft, Lonzo Ball and De’Aaron Fox. Of course, Fox won the matchup between the two guards in the game between UCLA and Kentucky in “March Madness” last season. It will be interesting to watch how both players respond to the spotlight, and the spotlight will possibly be the brightest for both on this night.</p>

<h4><b>Philadelphia 76ers @ Los Angeles Lakers, November 15th</b></h4>
<p>The teams of the future. The 76ers and Lakers have two of the brightest futures in the NBA. This matchup will consist of the top two players selected in the 2017 NBA Draft, Lonzo Ball and Markelle Fultz. The two will forever be linked to each other because of the positions they were drafted in. Their first matchup will set the tone for the rest of the times the two players meet throughout their career.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Minnesota Timberwolves @ Chicago Bulls, February 9th</b></h4>
<p>The return of Jimmy Butler. The Chicago Bulls dealt Jimmy Butler to the Minnesota Timberwolves on the night of the 2017 NBA Draft. Butler had spent his first six seasons in Chicago and became part of the community there. It will also be just the second time that Tom Thibodeau has returned to Chicago since his breakup with the Bulls’ front office. Along with Butler and Thibodeau, another Bulls’ fan favorite will be back in Chicago: Taj Gibson. All three former members of the Bulls’ organization will return to the United Center, a place they won so many games together.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Oklahoma City Thunder @ Indiana Pacers, December 13th</b></h4>
<p>The return of Paul George. Although George led the Pacers to six playoff appearances, Indiana fans will not be happy with him. This summer, George let the Pacers know that he would not re-sign with the team when he hits free agency next summer. The decision came at the worst time possible since the Pacers were given no leverage. The team had to move him for Domantas Sabonis and Victor Oladipo and start over. The return of Paul George could turn into a heated game between the Thunder and Pacers, one fans will definitely want to watch.</p>

<h4><b>Washington Wizards @ Boston Celtics, December 25th</b></h4>
<p>Who can’t remember the intense games between the Celtics and the Wizards last season? Ejections and fights all capped off with a game seven that the Celtics won in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. The Wizards and Celtics had some of the most heated matchups of the season last year and that is only expected to transfer over to this season. A matchup on Christmas is the perfect time for fans to check out a quality game between two of the top Eastern Conference teams.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Cleveland Cavaliers @ Golden State Warriors, December 25th</b></h4>
<p>Possibly the best Christmas day matchup will take place between the two teams that have been in the NBA Finals for the last three years. Cleveland and Golden State have now matched up in the NBA Finals for three straight years and this Christmas day matchup will also be the third straight matchup. The teams squared off in a very entertaining game last year that saw Kyrie Irving hit a game-winning shot as time was winding down. This year’s matchup should give NBA fans another reason to turn the TV on during the Christmas festivities.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Cleveland Cavaliers @ Washington Wizards, November 3rd</b></h4>
<p>The Cavs and Wizards took part in possibly the best game from last year’s regular season. The two teams squared off in Washington last season in February that saw one of the best back-and-forth affairs all season. The game consisted of 16 lead changes that ended in a Cavaliers victory in overtime. Bradley Beal totalled 41 points and Kevin Love had 39 for the Cavs. The game got into overtime because of the ridiculous shot that LeBron James hit at the end of the fourth quarter to tie the game. There is no doubt that whenever these two teams match up, it’s must-see TV.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Boston Celtics @ Utah Jazz, March 28th</b></h4>
<p>The return of Gordon Hayward. Hayward chose to leave Utah, where he spent his first seven seasons, to go to Boston and play for the Celtics. Hayward and Jazz fans will have to wait until late in the season for Hayward to come back to Utah, but Jazz fans will have plenty of time to get their “boo’s” ready. For a team that was centered around Hayward, the Jazz were just coming into their own, only to have their top player leave them in free agency.The Cavs and Wizards took part in possibly the best game from last year’s regular season.
