<p>For many years, the NBA’s All-Star Game has been all about the high-flying dunks and the deep threes. The games have zero defense and many fans get uninterested in the game. The score to the 2017 NBA All-Star Game? 192-182 in favor of the Western Conference. However, fans might not have to wait long to see changes. Adam Silver was recently asked about the NBA All-Star Game and he said: “I promise this time that next year’s will be different.” He continued on to say: “We've gotten to the point where everyone seemed to agree it needed to be more competitive. And by everyone, I mean including the players.” The NBA All-Star Game has been a joke for a number of years, but luckily, it may be changing.</p>
