<h1>Timberwolves: The good, bad, great, and ugly</h1>

<p>The Minnesota Timberwolves have had an interesting start to the 2017/18 NBA season. They currently hold the fifth seed in the Western Conference with a 10-7 record. They have had impressive wins against Oklahoma City twice, but have also had losses against the Phoenix Suns and the Indiana Pacers (without Jimmy Butler). With about 20% of the season wrapped up, let’s take a look at the good, bad, ugly, and great of the Timberwolves so far this season.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>The Good</b></h4>
<p>Jeff Teague: In the offseason, the Minnesota Timberwolves decided to move on from longtime point guard, Ricky Rubio. After trading Rubio to Utah, they brought in a new face to run the show at the point guard position: Jeff Teague. Teague has been inconsistent so far this season, but all in all, he has been a key part of the Timberwolves early success. Teague holds the second best three-point percentage on the team knocking down 40% of his threes so far this season. In addition, Teague is posting a team-high 7.3 assists per night. However, Teague does have some areas to improve upon. First, he needs to be more consistent. Teague will have nights where he lacks aggression and it hurts the team. When Teague is being aggressive, and finding the open man, the team typically plays well. Second, he needs to improve his shooting in the paint. He is shooting just 44.8% in the paint this season, well below league average. One of the biggest knocks on former Timberwolf point guard Ricky Rubio was his inability to finish at the rim. Last season, Rubio shot 44.9% in the paint for the Wolves, so it is safe to say that Teague needs to improve on his percentage. Lastly, Teague needs to have better communication on defense and work with Karl-Anthony Towns to figure out how to defend pick-and-rolls. Opposing teams are shooting the ball at a very high clip against the Timberwolves, and one of the biggest reasons for that is their inability to guard pick-and-rolls. This poor pick-and-roll defense has recently been on display in losses against Detroit and Charlotte. While Teague does have areas to improve upon, all in all, he has been a bright spot for the team this season.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>The Bad</b></h4>
<p>Timberwolves’ three-point shooting: Coming into the season, most people were concerned about the Timberwolves’ ability to knock down shots from deep. 17 games into the season and those worries have not gone away. While the Timberwolves are shooting 35.8% from three-point range this season, 16th in the NBA, they are only making 8.2 threes a game, third worst in the NBA. The Timberwolves do not have a lot of three-point shooters on their roster, but the hope was that the Wolves could cancel that out by all of the other fire power they have on the scoring end with Jimmy Butler, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Andrew Wiggins. However, when the Timberwolves have gotten behind in games, it has been hard for them to crawl back into the contest since they are not making a lot of threes. Against big name opponents like the Golden State Warriors and the Houston Rockets, the Timberwolves will need to have players that have the ability to hit shots from deep.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>The Great</b></h4>
<p>Nemanja Bjelica: Before getting injured at the end of last season, Nemanja Bjelica was in the midst of a breakout second half of the season last year. Fortunately for the Wolves, Bjelica picked up right where he left off before his injury last season. In just 15.8 minutes per game, Bjelica is averaging 7.5 points and 3.0 rebounds per game while shooting an NBA-best 53.8% from three. Bjelica has been a nice surprise off the bench for the Timberwolves this season, providing a spark each and every time he enters the game. However, up to this point, Tom Thibodeau has been reluctant to give him more minutes. If Bjelica were given the chance to play more, there is no reason he could not become an even bigger force and lead the Timberwolves to more victories.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>The Ugly</b></h4>
<p>Defense: Coming off of last season, one of the biggest concerns was the team’s defense. Most people anticipated that another season under Thibodeau and the additions of Jimmy Butler and Taj Gibson would fix the team’s defensive issues, but that has not been the case. In the first 17 games of the season, the Minnesota Timberwolves have allowed 107.6 points per game, 23rd in the NBA. In addition the Timberwolves have the sixth worst defensive efficiency and are allowing teams to shoot 48.5% from the field, worst in the NBA. Something has to change on the defensive end, the Timberwolves are getting killed in pick-and-roll situations and opponents are getting a lot of easy looks at the rim. But, not all hope is lost for the Wolves. While they are allowing the worst field goal percentage in the league, they are holding teams to just 34.6% shooting from three-point range, ninth best in the NBA. While that number may be surprising, it actually makes sense. If you pay close attention to the Wolves on defense, they close out hard to three-point shooters, causing them to pump fake and take midrange shots. While the Wolves have a ways to go on the defensive end, we are only 17 games into the season, and there is reason to believe that the Wolves will figure it out on the defensive end. In the end, if the Timberwolves figure it out on the defensive end, watch out, because so far this season they are 7-0 when they have help opponents under 100 points in a game.</p>
<p>The early parts of the Timberwolves’ season has been a whirlwind. There has been a lot of highs and a lot of lows, but in the end, I expect the Wolves to continue to build chemistry, and continue their push to bring a championship to Minnesota.</p>
