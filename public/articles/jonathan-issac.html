<h1>Jonathan Isaac Draft Profile</h1>

<p>Jonathan Isaac was a freshman at Florida State last year, and has made his decision to enter the 2017 NBA Draft. At 6’11” and 205lbs, Isaac is a long and thin forward that can play the small and power forward positions. Many trusted sports outlets (CBS, B/R, Draft Express) have Isaac projected as a top-ten draft selection. However, he still is not in the same conversation as fellow forwards Jayson Tatum and Josh Jackson. So, the big question everyone has is: “What will Jonathan Isaac bring to my team?”</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Strengths</b></h4>
<p>Let’s begin with what Isaac does well. Jonathan Isaac is a “jack of all trades” type of player. The biggest knock against him may be that he can do everything, but he does not excel at any one single thing. Last year in college, Isaac averaged 12 PPG, 7.8 RPG, and 2 BPG for Florida State. Isaac also posted a 24% efficiency rating and helped carry his team to an appearance in the NCAA tournament, “March Madness.” From the first highlight reel you watch, it is obvious that he has tremendous potential. Throughout his high school and college career he showed flashes of great passing ability and court vision for a player with his intangibles. He can run with anyone on the court and has shown great quickness for a player with his size. His ability to finesse the defender and make plays with the ball in his hands is truly fun to watch. He has the speed of a wing but the frame of a power forward, meaning he could play the three or four at the NBA level. Isaac has also proven that he can make sharp cuts and utilize the pick-and-roll on offense. With a 7’1” wingspan, he has the ability to go up and get rebounds off the glass. His wingspan also gives him great potential on the defensive side of the ball. With his lateral quickness and large frame, Isaac could wreak havoc on offensive game plans if given the opportunity. He also shot 35% from beyond the arc this season, and although streaky, he can catch fire and light up the scoreboard with his ability to create his own shot off the dribble. Last but not least, Isaac has arguably the highest ceiling of any forwards in the draft. Although he is also somewhat unpolished now, his floor is at a fair level and he will come in and contribute to any NBA team from day one.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Weaknesses</b></h4>
<p>Now for what he does not do well. Jonathan Isaac can be a very inconsistent and streaky scorer. He can go for thirty points some games, but a team can lock him down for five the next. There is also questions on whether or not his jumper can carry over to the NBA, as it is not fundamentally sound. Isaac can fall into the habit of hurrying his release, and consequently his left shoulder finished in front of his right at times. Isaac also has some bad habits when it comes to his scoring. His game film shows that he would rather shoot jumpers than back someone down in the post. His thin frame at just over 200 lbs lets him get knocked off of his path when slashing to the hoop rather easily. Isaac gets pushed around in the paint too and needs to work on forming a solid base and foundation to stay on. Isaac also tends to shy away from contact, a warning sign but something that can be fixed with a good coaching staff. His physicality can limit him to the point where he can get knocked around when fighting for a rebound. Isaac also needs to become better at fighting through screens, as he will need to do so at the NBA level. The last weakness of Isaac’s is his mentality. He does not seem to have an aggressive, clutch mindset which is crucial in big games. Despite this, his biggest issue is his physicality. He needs to become stronger and more aggressive if he wants to survive as a four in the NBA. The great thing about most of Isaac’s weaknesses is that they can be remedied. Although some of his habits may be ingrained to his system now, a good coaching/training staff can work out his bad habits and bulk him up quite a bit strength-wise.</p>

<h4><b>NBA Comparison</b></h4>
<p>Tayshaun Prince. Prince was a great defender in his prime and was able to stretch the floor. While Isaac certainly has the capability to surpass Prince in terms of ability, the two are very similar based on their builds and playstyles.
<br><br>
So, to answer the question: “What will Jonathan Isaac bring to my team?” He will contribute the minute he steps on the floor and has the potential to become a star. While Isaac may never be the MVP of the league, a “Swiss Army Knife” type player can be very valuable to many teams.</p>
