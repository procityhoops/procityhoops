<p>While the playoffs are roughly three months away many teams are just now playing roughly their 50th games of the season, and the playoff picture in both the eastern and western conference is beginning to take shape. As expected at the start of the season, Golden State and Cleveland are running away with their respective conferences. While Cleveland has recently hit a rough patch, they got back on track Wednesday night against the Timberwolves, and Charles Barkley has officially awoken LeBron James. Obviously, a lot can change in the coming months, but both conferences have some surprising teams in playoff contention. In the west, hypothetically every team can still make a playoff push, and the eastern conference is equally as tight. In this article, we’ll dive into every team in playoff contention, and determine if they are going to be a contender or pretender down the stretch.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Eastern Conference:</b></h4>

<h5><b><u>Contenders:</b></u></h5>

<p><b>Charlotte Hornets (23-27):</b> Charlotte is in the midst of a six-game losing streak. While the Hornets are not playing good basketball at the moment, they have the potential to get hot down the stretch. Due to the experience gained from last years’ playoff run, they will right the ship and lock up a spot in the top 8.<p>
<br>
<p><b>Milwaukee Bucks (21-27):</b> Much like Charlotte, Milwaukee is 1-9 in their last 10 contests. While Milwaukee seems to be in a full-blown tailspin, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker will get back to their winning ways down the stretch and secure the opportunity to play Cleveland in round one.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Miami Heat (20-30):</b> Hassan Whiteside, Dion Waiters and Goran Dragic, the new big three? Not quite. While Miami is on an absolute tear of late, I do not believe they can maintain this momentum throughout the season and will eventually fall short of a playoff berth. With that being said, Miami, Milwaukee, and Charlotte will continue to be in a dogfight as we approach April.</p>
<br>
<h5><b><u>Pretenders:</b></u></h5>

<p><b>Chicago Bulls (25-25):</b> No team in the NBA is in more disarray than the Chicago Bulls. Jimmy Butler and Dwayne Wade seem to have separated themselves from the rest of the team causing turmoil throughout the entire organization. I expect to see Chicago field offers for both Wade and Butler at the deadline, and determining their best bet is to begin the rebuilding process.</p>
<br>
<p><b>New York Knicks (22-29):</b> If the Knicks hold onto Carmelo Anthony, they have a real chance at the eight seed due to the recent struggles of the Hornets and Bucks. With that being said, New York would be wise to move on from Carmelo Anthony and begin the Kristaps Porzingis era in the big apple.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Philadelphia 76ers (18-31):</b> Trusting the process is fun and all, but can Philadelphia keep up their January momentum? Ben Simmons will help, but I believe they will continue to build momentum throughout the remainder of the season in an effort to ramp up for a playoff berth next season</p>
<br>
<p><b>Not mentioned:</b><br> Brooklyn Nets (9-40)</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Western Conference:</b></h4>

<h5><b><u>Contenders:</b></u></h5>

<p><b>Portland Trailblazers (22-28):</b> CJ McCollum is having a career season, and Damian Lillard remains a perennial all-star snub. While they lack any resemblance of a post threat, their guard play is elite in today’s NBA. Look for McCollum and Lillard to get on a roll and secure the 8 seed with the reward of playing Golden State in round one.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Denver Nuggets (21-27):</b> Nikola Jokic is well on his way to being a top 5 big man in the NBA. Since moving to center this season, all Jokic has done is average roughly 16 points, 9 rebounds and 4 assists per game. While Jokic is on his way to super stardom, Danilo Gallinari and Wilson Chandler are additionally both having excellent seasons. Recent news out of Denver suggests Chandler has requested to be traded, and this could be a death sentence for a potential playoff berth for the Nuggets.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Dallas Mavericks (19-30):</b> After early season ping pong ball chasing, Dallas has gone 8-3 their past 11 games to sneak back into playoff contention in the west. Harrison Barnes has been impressive this season, Dirk has been a model of consistency since returning from injury and recent 10-day contract signee Yogi Ferrell has breathed life back into the point guard position for the Mavericks. Rick Carlisle is one of the best coaches in the NBA, and leading this current Maverick team to the playoffs would be one of his finest accomplishments to date.</p>
<br>
<h5><b><u>Pretenders:</b></u></h5>

<p><b>Minnesota Timberwolves (19-30):</b> While Minnesota has one of the brightest futures in the league, they still lack the necessary experience to seriously contend down the stretch. The fact that Minnesota is still in contention is quite remarkable after their 6-18 start. Tom Thibodeau is going to be kicking himself all offseason about the third quarter and late game collapses early in the season. However, the young Wolves seem to be turning a corner and are a veteran, and a couple of bench players away from being a consistent playoff team in the west.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Sacramento Kings (19-30):</b> Poor Boogie Cousins. Demarcus Cousins is having a remarkable season, however, Sacramento consistently fails to put a competent team around him. Cousins is averaging 28 points and 11 rebounds a game and this is still not enough for Sacramento to consistently win games. While losing Rudy Gay is huge, Dave Joerger is a great NBA coach and will do everything in his power to make Sacramento contend down the stretch.</p>
<br>
<p><b>New Orleans Pelicans (19-31):</b> Much like Demarcus Cousins, poor Anthony Davis. While Davis still struggles to stay healthy, he continues to be one of the most dominant players in the NBA when he plays. Davis is yet again averaging 28 points and 12 rebounds per, but the Pelicans continue to disappoint. Since returning from his hiatus early this season, Jrue Holiday has impressed averaging 16 points and 8 assists per game, but this is still not enough for the Pelicans to snag the 8 seed in the west.</p>

Los Angeles Lakers (17-35)

Phoenix Suns (15-34)
