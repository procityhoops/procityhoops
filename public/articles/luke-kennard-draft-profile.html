<p>Luke Kennard is a 20 (soon to be 21) year old shooting guard from Duke University. Kennard was a unanimous All-ACC team selection and a second team All-American in his sophomore year at Duke. A lights-out shooter with limited defensive ability, Kennard led Duke to a long run in the NCAA “March Madness” tournament before losing to South Carolina. A projected lottery pick in this year’s NBA Draft, Luke Kennard is going to be a fan-favorite in the NBA with his shooting ability and will be an exciting selection to whichever team takes him.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Strengths</b></h4>
<p>Kennard has a great ability to hit from NBA range beyond-the-arc, as he consistently shot from deep in college. He lead Duke in scoring this year with 19.5 PPG while shooting 49% from the field. He has polished footwork that is rarely seen from college guards and can get around defenders with his spin moves. Kennard also shows up in big games and has one of if not the best clutch genes in this class. His feel for the game and natural offensive instincts have NBA executives excited about his offensive potential. An interesting thing about Kennard that casual fans don’t often notice is his playmaking ability that goes along with his shooting. He uses his size on offense (6’6”) to create for himself and his teammates. While his wingspan may hurt his defensive upside at only 6’5”, it improves his shooting ability. He has a tight handle with the ball and is probably the best player in the draft at coming off of screens. Although he lacks elite athleticism and quickness, he often played point guard at Duke and can be a mismatch for smaller guards in the NBA. His instincts and high basketball IQ come into play on the offensive side. When pressured he rarely turns the ball over and doesn’t often panic. He keeps the ball moving at a good pace and makes quick decisions with the ball in his hands. Kennard can creatively pass with both hands and he also excels at shooting floaters. Although he doesn’t excel at it, he posses the ability to play the ISO game well. On the defensive side of things, Kennard is a smart off ball defender. Contrary to popular belief, he plays solid team defense and contributes on that side of the ball. Overall, Kennard plays with high confidence and his strengths make him a sure lottery pick this year</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Weaknesses</b></h4>
<p>Most of Kennard’s weaknesses come on the defensive side of the ball. His potential is limited overall because of his lacking athleticism and length, something that is concerning to NBA teams. He’s not a super physical player and lacks toughness on defense. He isn’t quick enough to guard most point guards at the NBA level. Kennard lacks urgency on closeouts and can’t fight through screens, something he’ll need to work on for the next level. He is often targeted by bigger wings in the post and has the tendency to let the offense run through him. He struggles at on-ball defense overall and can be caught sleeping at times. Kennard also struggles to recover on the play after he gets beat. Although Kennard can bulk up, his frame limits his potential size and there’s no guarantee he will ever improve on defense. On the offensive side of things, it’s more of the same. His lacking athleticism hurts his potential ability to create offense at the next level. He has an average first step and often doesn’t beat defenders to the hoop. Although he has a tight handle, his moves seem to be limited to spin moves and step backs which make him predictable when driving. A lot of this was overlooked in college, but it may hurt him against lengthier defenders in the NBA. The biggest issue with Kennard is that a lot of his issues are tough to work around and build upon at the NBA, limiting his potential overall.While there seem to be a lot of weaknesses to his game, they aren’t necessarily a major issue. Players that excel at offense and not defense can still carve great careers out in the NBA (See Kyle Korver, JJ Redick, etc.).</p>

<h4><b>NBA Comparison</b></h4>
<p>J.J. Redick. Kennard has the potential to be a better player than Redick in the NBA, but the comparison is an obvious one. A sharpshooter with passing ability and polished footwork clearly goes hand in hand with Redick’s game.</p>
