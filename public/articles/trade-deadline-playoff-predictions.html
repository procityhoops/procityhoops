<h1>Post-Trade Deadline Playoff Predictions</h1>

<p>For what was supposed to be a boring day in the NBA in terms of trades turned out to be the exact opposite. There was a flurry of deals that went down earlier today, many of the biggest moves being made by the Cleveland Cavaliers. After a number of teams made moves to either better position themselves for this year or the future, let’s take a look at how the playoff picture could finish out this season.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Current Western Conference Playoff Standings:</b> Warriors, Rockets, Spurs, Wolves, Thunder, Nuggets, Blazers, Pelicans</p>
<p><b>Projected Western Conference Playoff Standings:</b> Warriors, Rockets, Spurs, Thunder, Wolves, Nuggets, Blazers, Clippers</p>

<br>

<p>For the Western Conference, I don’t see a lot of shifting around before the season ends. I believe that the top three will stay the way it is currently configured. I do have the Thunder sliding ahead of the Wolves into the fourth seed, giving them home-court advantage against Minnesota in the first round. The Nuggets will be a very compelling team in the sixth seed in the West. They have played the majority of the season without Paul Millsap, and when he returns to the lineup next to Jokic, there is no telling how much damage the Nuggets could do in April. Finally, the last change I have is the Clippers sneaking into the eighth spot in the West pushing the Pelicans out of the playoff picture. With the injury to DeMarcus Cousins, I don’t think New Orleans has what it takes to finish out the season strong. And, on the other side, the Clippers didn’t sell as much at the deadline as many people expected them to, so I expect they will continue to be in the thick of things fighting for the final Western Conference playoff spot.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Current Eastern Conference Playoff Standings:</b> Celtics, Raptors, Cavs, Wizards, Bucks, Pacers, Heat, Sixers</p>
<p><b>Projected Eastern Conference Playoff Standings:</b> Celtics, Raptors, Cavs, Bucks, Wizards, Heat, Pistons, Sixers</p>

<br>

<p>The Eastern Conference will have a very interesting final couple of weeks to determine the playoff picture. As it currently sits, the five and nine seeds are separated by just three games, proving that anything can happen. Even with the moves they made today, I expect the Cavs to stick in the third spot in the East because of the hole they have dug themselves into. From there, I think the Bucks will leapfrog the Wizards for the fourth spot as Giannis, Bledsoe, and Jabari continue to gel, and I believe the Pacers will drop out of the playoffs. I like how the Pacers have played this season so far, but with the lack of real veteran leadership on that team, they might fall off late in the season. The team that will jump into the playoffs and take the Pacers place will be the Pistons. Aside from the Cavs, the Pistons were the most active team at the deadline. They have not lost since acquiring Blake Griffin, and when Reggie Jackson returns from injury, their team will get even scarier. I also see the Sixers holding onto the eighth spot in the East, allowing Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid to gain valuable playoff experience.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Finals Prediction:</b> In the end, I still think the season will come down to the Warriors and the Cavs. The Cavs may not have actually gotten a ton better in terms of talent today, but they got new faces in the locker room, and they certainly got a lot younger and more athletic. The Warriors will be tough to beat, and in the end, I think Golden State takes home another title, but this time in six games.</p>
