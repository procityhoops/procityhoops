<p>The Philadelphia 76ers finished the 2016-2017 NBA season with a record of 28-54, 18 more wins than the previous season. Joel “The process” Embiid was a big reason why. Embiid finished the season averaging 20.2 points and 7.8 rebounds per game. Unfortunately for Sixer fans, Embiid only played 31 games. The 76ers were also without first overall pick Ben Simmons for the entire season. Had the Sixers been at full strength all season, they would have likely won even more than 28 games on the year. Another big bright spot for the Sixers last season was Dario Saric. Saric averaged 12.8 points and 6.3 rebounds in his rookie season in the NBA. Already with a strong young nucleus, Bryan Colangelo didn’t want to stop there. The weekend before the 2017 NBA Draft, the team made a move to acquire the top selection from last Thursday’s NBA Draft, and it allowed them to select Markelle Fultz. Sixer fans around the country now have every reason to be excited going into the 2017-2018 NBA season, but what can the Sixers do in this year’s free agency to make them even more excited.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Max Cap Space: $60 Million</b></h4>
<br>
<h4><b>Pending Free Agents:</b></h4>
<p>Restricted: Alex Poythress<br>
Unrestricted: Sergio Rodriguez, Tiago Splitter</p>
<p>Much like many other teams in this year’s free agency, the 76ers don’t have much to worry about in terms of retaining their own players. The biggest name on the list is Sergio Rodriguez who is already 31 years old. The Sixers could choose to re-sign Rodriguez to a cheap deal and have him help mentor Markelle Fultz, but with T.J. McConnell slotted to be the backup for Fultz, Rodriguez would likely not see any court time. As for Poythress and Splitter, they would be better off walking and finding a job elsewhere. Of the two, Splitter has a slight chance to stick around, but it’s highly unlikely. Splitter played in just eight games for the Sixers last season, and he would be able to find more court time elsewhere.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Free Agent Targets:</b></h4>
<p>J.J. Redick, Andre Iguodala</p>
<p>The Philadelphia 76ers will have the cap space this offseason to focus on acquiring some veteran talent not only to help them win but to help mentor the young guys. Redick would supply the Sixers with a much-needed shooter at the shooting guard position. The Sixers are currently set up to have Nik Stauskas play that position, but Redick would be a much better option. Redick would also benefit from playing with guys like Markelle Fultz and Ben Simmons. Redick can spot up on the outside and wait for the ball when Fultz and Simmons are attacking the rim. Iguodala would also be a great veteran presence, and he would help the Sixers tremendously on the defensive end. While the Sixers should be able to put up terrific numbers on the offensive end, they will need to improve on the defensive end if they want to continue winning more games. Both players will demand a lot of money, but Colangelo will be more than willing to fork it over to help out a very young team.</p>
