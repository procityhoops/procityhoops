<p><b>What:</b> Timberwolves @ Lakers <br>
<b>When: </b>9/30, 9 p.m. ct. <br>
<b>Where: </b>Anaheim, California <br>
<b>TV:</b> NBA TV, FSN Plus
</p>
<p>Wolves fans, the time has come! The new-look Timberwolves are back in action. After adding Jimmy Butler, Taj Gibson, Jeff Teague, Jamal Crawford, and others over the offseason, this will be the first time that we can see them in action together. This will be the first of three preseason games for the Wolves, and the only game that will be played in the United States. After the game against the Lakers, the Wolves will catch a flight to China, where they will play their last two preseason games against the Warriors. Since the Wolves have just three preseason games, that makes tonight’s game even more important.</p>
<h3><b>What to watch for</b></h3>
<h4><b>Lineup combinations</b></h4>
<p>With just three games to be played before the Wolves head to San Antonio for opening night, Tom Thibodeau will not be able to waste any time in figuring out some good lineup combinations. I suspect the Wolves to open the game with Jeff Teague, Andrew Wiggins, Jimmy Butler, Taj Gibson, and Karl-Anthony Towns. It will be interesting to see how the starting unit plays together for the first time in live action. The next thing to watch for is if Thibs decides to stagger in the bench. A lot of coaches like to keep some of their starters on the floor at the same time as their bench, so it will be interesting to see how Thibs approaches that tonight. I anticipate the starters to play around 22-26 minutes tonight, and it will give the Wolves a good building block moving forward.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Tyus Jones vs Aaron Brooks</b></h4>
<p>For the majority of the offseason, the Timberwolves were only carrying two point guards: Jeff Teague and Tyus Jones. Just a couple days before camp opened, however, the Wolves added Aaron Brooks into the point guard mix. With Teague being the obvious starter, Thibodeau said during practice last week that he would let the backup point guard battle play itself out. So, tonight is the first chance for Jones and Brooks to prove that they deserve the spot behind Teague.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Lonzo Ball</b></h4>
<p>One of the biggest storylines all summer has been Lonzo Ball and his father, LaVar Ball. Tonight will be the first live NBA action for the second overall selection out of UCLA. Lonzo had a solid NBA Summer League, being named the NBA Summer League MVP. He has reportedly kept up his high level of play in camp thus far, carrying a perfect record in team scrimmages. It will be up to Jeff Teague and the Timberwolves defense to slow him down tonight. It will also be fun to see some of the Wolves’ bigs switch onto Lonzo and see how they handle a much quicker player than them.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Offensive spacing and shooting</b></h4>
<p>While the Timberwolves made some big moves this summer, they still lack a knockdown three-point shooter. Tonight will be the first test to see who might step up this season and be a knockdown shooter from outside. Could it be Wiggins? Butler? Teague? Towns? I guess we will just have to wait and see. Another area to keep an eye on tonight will be who gets the majority of the offensive touches. The Timberwolves have four players that all had the ball in their hands a lot last season: Jimmy Butler, Andrew Wiggins, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Jeff Teague. It will be interesting to see how those four players co-exist, especially early in the season.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Prediction</b></h4>
<p>I do not anticipate the Wolves to play great tonight. They have only been practicing for one week, and the team has a bunch of new faces. I anticipate the starters to struggle early, but start to play better in the second half. I see the Lakers coming out on top by a score of 107-99. I think Lonzo will have a solid debut posting around 12 points and recording 7 assists. I think Muhammad will lead the Wolves in scoring with 15 points, but it will not be enough for the Wolves to come out on top. Enjoy the game!</p>
