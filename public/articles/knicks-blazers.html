<p>ESPN has reported that the New York Knicks and the Portland Trail Blazers are in talks for the Knicks to acquire one of the Blazers' first-round picks in the 2017 NBA Draft. Portland owns the #15, #20, and #26 picks in the draft. Phil Jackson has been searching for an extra pick in previous weeks, and he wants to make two selections in the star-studded 2017 Draft. The Knicks are searching for young talent to put next to Kristaps Porzingis. At this point it isn't clear as to who the Blazers would want in return, but it will be an interesting story to keep an eye on.</p>
