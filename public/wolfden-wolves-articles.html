<p>With the full 2017-18 NBA schedule finally releasing, it’s time to take a look at what games NBA fans should be keeping their eye on.</p>
<h4><b>Boston Celtics @ Cleveland Cavaliers, October 17th</b></h4>
<p>With the Celtics and Cavaliers battling on opening night, it will be the first time that NBA fans will be able to see the new-look Celtics. The Celtics traded Avery Bradley away this offseason and signed all-star, Gordon Hayward. The team also used the third overall selection in the 2017 NBA Draft to take Duke forward, Jayson Tatum. Both players will make their Celtics’ debut in a Eastern Conference Finals rematch from 2017. This could also mark the first game that Kyrie Irving is not a member of the Cavaliers since the 2010-11 season.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Houston Rockets @ Golden State Warriors, October 17th</b></h4>
<p>The Golden State Warriors open the 2017-18 season at home against the new-look Rockets. It will be ring night for the defending NBA champions which makes it a compelling contest to watch. On top of ring night, it will also be the first chance for fans to see the Rockets with their new look. The Rockets made a blockbuster trade this offseason that brought the team Chris Paul to pair next to James Harden. The team will also be without several key contributors from the team last season including Patrick Beverley, Lou Williams, and Sam Dekker.</p>
<br>
<h4><b>Los Angeles Lakers @ Sacramento Kings, November 22nd</b></h4>
<p>A matchup of two of the top point guards in the 2017 NBA Draft, Lonzo Ball and De’Aaron Fox. Of course, Fox won the matchup between the two guards in the game between UCLA and Kentucky in “March Madness” last season. It will be interesting to watch how both players respond to the spotlight, and the spotlight will possibly be the brightest for both on this night.</p>

<h1>Boston Celtics Free Agency Preview</h1>
<p>The Boston Celtics had a terrific 2016-2017 season. They finished as the top seed in the Eastern Conference with a record of 53-29. However, the Celtics were knocked off in the Eastern Conference Finals by LeBron and the Cavs. But, the Celtics didn’t hang their heads. The Celtics had the #1 pick in the 2017 NBA Draft before trading it to Philadelphia for a future pick and the third pick in the 2017 NBA Draft. The Celtics took Jayson Tatum with the third pick last week, who some are comparing to the next Paul Pierce. While the Celtics had a successful draft, they need to make a splash in free agency to overcome LeBron in the East.</p>
