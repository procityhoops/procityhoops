<h1>Timberwolves: The good, bad, great, and ugly</h1>
<div id="author">

<h4><b>The Good</b></h4>
<p>Jeff Teague: In the offseason, the Minnesota Timberwolves decided to move on from longtime point guard, Ricky Rubio. After trading Rubio to Utah, they brought in a new face to run the show at the point guard position: Jeff Teague. Teague has been inconsistent so far this season, but all in all, he has been a key part of the Timberwolves early success. Teague holds the second best three-point percentage on the team knocking down 40% of his threes so far this season. In addition, Teague is posting a team-high 7.3 assists per night. However, Teague does have some areas to improve upon. First, he needs to be more consistent. Teague will have nights where he lacks aggression and it hurts the team. When Teague is being aggressive, and finding the open man, the team typically plays well. Second, he needs to improve his shooting in the paint. He is shooting just 44.8% in the paint this season, well below league average. One of the biggest knocks on former Timberwolf point guard Ricky Rubio was his inability to finish at the rim. Last season, Rubio shot 44.9% in the paint for the Wolves, so it is safe to say that Teague needs to improve on his percentage. Lastly, Teague needs to have better communication on defense and work with Karl-Anthony Towns to figure out how to defend pick-and-rolls. Opposing teams are shooting the ball at a very high clip against the Timberwolves, and one of the biggest reasons for that is their inability to guard pick-and-rolls. This poor pick-and-roll defense has recently been on display in losses against Detroit and Charlotte. While Teague does have areas to improve upon, all in all, he has been a bright spot for the team this season.</p>
<h4><b>The Bad</b></h4>
<p>Timberwolves’ three-point shooting: Coming into the season, most people were concerned about the Timberwolves’ ability to knock down shots from deep. 17 games into the season and those worries have not gone away. While the Timberwolves are shooting 35.8% from three-point range this season, 16th in the NBA, they are only making 8.2 threes a game, third worst in the NBA. The Timberwolves do not have a lot of three-point shooters on their roster, but the hope was that the Wolves could cancel that out by all of the other fire power they have on the scoring end with Jimmy Butler, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Andrew Wiggins. However, when the Timberwolves have gotten behind in games, it has been hard for them to crawl back into the contest since they are not making a lot of threes. Against big name opponents like the Golden State Warriors and the Houston Rockets, the Timberwolves will need to have players that have the ability to hit shots from deep.</p>

<h1>2017-18 Wolves Season Preview Questions</h1>
<div id="author">
<p>By: Devan Olsem</p>
</div>
<p><b>Question from @Gee_manLeo16: What position do you think we are lacking in?</b></p>
<p>Answer: While it is hard to pinpoint one specific position, one area I am still concerned about is the team’s three-point shooting. In order to make a big statement this season the Wolves will need knock-down shooters, and at the moment, I do not think we have that. The Wolves will be able to score the ball, but there are some instances in which a team needs three-point shooting in order to get back into games and put teams away down the stretch.</p>
<p><b>Question from @Lenzy2108: What do you see happening at backup point guard? Brooks or Tyus?</b></p>
<p>Answer: At least to start the season, it seems that Tyus will be in charge of leading the second unit, but that can change as the season progresses. Even though Tyus will get the first chance to secure the backup point guard spot, any sort of mishaps or bad play can change things very quickly.</p>
<p><b>Question from @KoKoPuffs29: With how skilled of an offense we will have, how concerned are we really about three-point shooting?</b></p>
<p>Answer: As I eluded to before, even though our offense will be able to put the ball in the basket, we do not have a guy that can sit on the outside and just knock down shots. There is a level of concern that we will eventually need a three-point specialist, but let’s see how the season starts, and maybe we can even rely on our defense a little bit.</p>

<h1>Timberwolves: Playoffs or Bust?</h1>
<div id="author">
<p>By: Devan Olsem</p>

<p>When the Minnesota Timberwolves open up the 2017-18 season in San Antonio on October 18th, they will have a very different look. The Timberwolves will only have six players from last seasons roster return this year, unless Shabazz Muhammad decides to return on a veterans minimum deal before the start of the season. Although the Wolves will only be returning six players from last years roster, it may not be the worst case scenario. Minnesota has not made the playoffs since the 2003-04 season, and they were just 31-51 last season, 13th in the Western Conference.</p>
<p>The young Wolves team was projected to make a big jump last season when new coach Tom Thibodeau was hired. However, that was not the case. The Wolves struggled early, especially on the defensive side of the ball. They started playing well in the middle of the season trying to make a late playoff push, but in the end, it was all for naught. Now, the Minnesota Timberwolves are coming off one of their most important offseasons in recent history that saw the team make a load of changes.</p>
<p>The first change, and biggest, came on the night of the 2017 NBA Draft. Leading up to the draft, there was some buzz that the Timberwolves could look to move out of the seventh overall pick, but nobody expected a blockbuster deal to happen. Just moments before the draft opened, it was announced that the Timberwolves had shipped out the seventh pick, Zach LaVine, and Kris Dunn to the Chicago Bulls for Jimmy Butler and the 16th overall selection in the draft that night, which they used to select Justin Patton. NBA fans around the world were in awe. Wolves fans, accustomed to progressing players and trading away stars, were mostly excited that they were finally on the receiving end of a star being traded. Butler, one of the top two-way players in the league, played for Tom Thibodeau for four seasons before the Bulls let Thibs go. Butler will make an immediate impact especially on the defensive end of the court, where the Wolves struggled mightily last season.</p>
