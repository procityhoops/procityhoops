<h1>Timberwolves: Playoffs or Bust?</h1>

<p>When the Minnesota Timberwolves open up the 2017-18 season in San Antonio on October 18th, they will have a very different look. The Timberwolves will only have six players from last seasons roster return this year, unless Shabazz Muhammad decides to return on a veterans minimum deal before the start of the season. Although the Wolves will only be returning six players from last years roster, it may not be the worst case scenario. Minnesota has not made the playoffs since the 2003-04 season, and they were just 31-51 last season, 13th in the Western Conference.</p>
<p>The young Wolves team was projected to make a big jump last season when new coach Tom Thibodeau was hired. However, that was not the case. The Wolves struggled early, especially on the defensive side of the ball. They started playing well in the middle of the season trying to make a late playoff push, but in the end, it was all for naught. Now, the Minnesota Timberwolves are coming off one of their most important offseasons in recent history that saw the team make a load of changes.</p>
<p>The first change, and biggest, came on the night of the 2017 NBA Draft. Leading up to the draft, there was some buzz that the Timberwolves could look to move out of the seventh overall pick, but nobody expected a blockbuster deal to happen. Just moments before the draft opened, it was announced that the Timberwolves had shipped out the seventh pick, Zach LaVine, and Kris Dunn to the Chicago Bulls for Jimmy Butler and the 16th overall selection in the draft that night, which they used to select Justin Patton. NBA fans around the world were in awe. Wolves fans, accustomed to progressing players and trading away stars, were mostly excited that they were finally on the receiving end of a star being traded. Butler, one of the top two-way players in the league, played for Tom Thibodeau for four seasons before the Bulls let Thibs go. Butler will make an immediate impact especially on the defensive end of the court, where the Wolves struggled mightily last season.</p>
